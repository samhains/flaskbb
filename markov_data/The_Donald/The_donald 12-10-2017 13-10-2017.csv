This false dichotomy is a position taken by desparate mental midgets who are either too ignorant or too lazy to entertain the idea that there are always other valid positions. It's such an exclusionary position that it ends up hurting the user of such logic. 

I'm increasingly hearing this sentiment  echoed by POTUS haters and I gotta tell ya, it amplifies their utter desparation. It makes them look like their backs are against the wall. They've got nothing left. The walls are caving in on them. Which brings me to my next point.

We all believe the influx of ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù and migrants are causing the collapse of Europe and are without doubt causing a spike in terror attacks and rapes. Not to mention the countries bringing these Jihadist infiltrators into Europe are having massive economic problems due to the welfare these migrants receive and their inability to find jobs. Though this is not surprising as bringing in 3rd world people into civilized society will only cause more chaos. Most of these people are coming in are men too. Where are the women and children? It‚Äôs full grown able body men that have the latest Samsung phones lol. Bringing in low IQ people from terror invested Muslim countries will only bring more damage and costs to the society they are supposed t assimilate too. These men have no idea of basic things like women‚Äôs rights (feminists maybe u should focus on this instead complaining about a non existent wage gap, as Sweden has become the rape capital of Europe with Germany not far behind.) We must all unite and oppose this invasion before the fabric is society is ripped apart and all the culture and values our ancestors fought for are all gone in the name of diversity. Sadly many people are too afraid to speak out because of a fear of being politically incorrect but labeled a nazi. But fuck that. Western society will be gone in all but a few decades if we don‚Äôt take action now. Countries such as Hungary and Poland are leading the way by building fences and rejecting Islam. They are true patriots that love their county and will die defending it. The European Union is essentially a globalist test run of a world government and the EU believe they have authority over sovereign nations. However they only real way to stay diverse is to have individually sovereign nations that have their own identity and culture. I am a proud American and will always fight to oppose things like this to come to our country. I am also a proud Hungarian who is not ashamed of believing in my right to support &amp; defend our way of life and ethnic homogeneity. We will stop then Muslim invaders just like my ancestors did hundreds of years ago. We will fight till the end and i encourage everyone to support a country‚Äôs right to make its own decisions and let their people decide what is the right thing to do, as a true democracy allows. God bless Hungary and God bless the United States.

Don't get me wrong, I *hate* Dunham.  I dislike everything I've ever seen about her.  She needs to be taken to task, at some point, for the things that she has admitted to doing in her own words.  

That being said, she does have a point.  I can only imagine the position of the woman that originally brought claims against Weinstein: this is someone that managed to get the likes of rich, connected A-listers to not only keep quiet about him molesting them, but also get them to *actively reinforce and aid him in his habit*.  Coming forward to say something would have been career suicide, and maybe literal suicide as well.

Feel free to check my post history: I'm here to fucking MAGA just as much as anyone else.  But this culture where we constantly nitpick at one another over things unrelated to the conversation at hand is going to need to come to an end if we are ever to have a hope of working together in the future, which we inevitably will.  We can't keep this ""Well I see your point, but YOU did (X) in the past so you have no bearing here"" stuff, since all it does is further muddy the waters and make it so that nothing comes to a resolution.

Trump won, and conservatism is on the rise, but the same thing could have been said in reverse during the years of the Berkeley riots and the civil rights discussions.  The pendulum always swings the other way, we just happen to be living at the apex of one of those swings. ",The_Donald

&gt;MICHELE LORD
June 23, 2015
Michele Lord is one of the two presidents of NEO Philanthropy (her co-president is Berta Col√≥n), an innovative non-profit that advances social change. Together, Lord and Col√≥n have created an organization that offers a range of services‚Äîorganizing collaborative funds and spearheading donor advised funds, to name two‚Äîthat help donors make visible and lasting change in the social justice space. The goal, Lord says, ‚Äúis to meet people where they are, and maybe by going there, and going a little deeper there, they may be interested in doing something else. That‚Äôs how we see our value-add. It‚Äôs a much deeper conversation.‚Äù To continue plumbing the depths, read on!
 
&gt;When I first heard of your organization, you were being rebranded. What prompted that change?

The organization has been around for 30 years. Before I came on fourteen years ago, it had a reputation of being a fiscal sponsor. It didn‚Äôt have any staff. It didn‚Äôt have any budget. We were the backroom for lots of organizations that didn‚Äôt have their own 501(c)(3).
 
&gt;What do you mean when you say backroom?

We provided financial support, management support and legal support. A lot of groups didn‚Äôt want to get their own 501(c)(3). So they couldn‚Äôt get foundation dollars. We were able to do it for them. We did their HR as needed, their accounting, all of that. We were known as Public Interest Projects then. I had been working for a very wealthy family in their family office, and I‚Äôd become very interested in the whole collaborative idea, of foundations coming together and capitalizing a fund, so that they could do their grantmaking together around a particular strategy. When I came on board, I was very interested in creating a model that would do it differently and better than where I was. We started with one collaborative fund, and now we‚Äôve done over twelve of them. We still work as a fiscal sponsor, and we also do donor advised funds.
 
&gt;So that shift in focus is what inspired you to change the name?

The name Public Interest Projects was essentially picked out of a hat. The original founder, Donald Ross, wanted the organization to be under the radar so that people wouldn‚Äôt necessarily know what it did. Before I came, we were always in the back, never in the front. Once we started developing our work, the name became confusing to people. It didn‚Äôt say who we were, and it didn‚Äôt say anything about our values.
 
&gt;It didn‚Äôt give you a concrete identity.

Right. We had just gone along with it for years and years and years because we were so busy building the organization. We started with zero, and now we have a budget of $52 million. We have over 40 staff members, we‚Äôve done 12 collaborative funds, we have almost 40 fiscally sponsored projects and donor-advised projects. A couple of years ago, one of our board members said, ‚ÄúYour name doesn‚Äôt say anything about who you are.‚Äù So we thought, okay, let‚Äôs consider a rebranding process. The whole idea was to think through, ‚ÄúWhat do we want people to think about us? What values do we care about? What things are important to us? Who is our audience?‚Äù It was almost like doing a strategic plan, but doing it in a different way. It was about connecting the dots for people, to be able to show them that there are many different ways of being involved with us. You could have a donor advised fund, you could support one of our projects, or you could join one of our collaborative funds.
 
&gt;How do you see those three things‚Äîdonor advised funds, donating to projects and collaborative funds‚Äîworking together? How do they create a robust brand narrative that you guys can stand behind?

We have folks who have a donor-advised fund with us, and they fund one of our collaborative funds. There are many ways to get money out the door. But we‚Äôre not a transactional shop. There are lots of places that have donor advised funds where the donor calls up and says, ‚ÄúWrite these checks to these organizations.‚Äù We do it very differently. The donors we tend to work with often want to go deeper, and they want the program expertise that our staff has. Our staff is full of highly developed program-rich people, and it‚Äôs a much richer model. We can be transactional, and we have been. The rebranding helped us get to the place where we are now. It helped us figure out how to talk to people about our strengths. We know where our niche is and our space. If we had gone through a very traditional strategic planning process that many people go through, I don‚Äôt think we would have gotten to the other side. We wanted something radically different from other people in our field.",The_Donald

A reader recently sent me a Form 990 here for something called NEO Philanthropy which includes a list of dozens and dozens of NO borders groups and immigrant and refugee promoting groups they fund.

As a matter of fact, you should use the list starting on page 35 of the Form 990 as a guide to figure out who organizes against you, American citizens, in your communities.

We bring you this information so that you know, as you build your ‚Äòpockets of resistance,‚Äô that the other side, working with Obama, is rolling in millions of dollars of laundered money to work against you, to change your towns and to change the electorate.  But, do not be discouraged! Take heart and understand you are the David working against their Goliath. (We know how that story ended!)

Use this information to understand who they are.

Why launder money through an organization like this?

There are large private donors who do not want their names associated with groups on this list, so they send their millions to NEO Philanthropy which then doles it out.

We recognize some of the ‚Äòsocial change‚Äô groups listed on their many pages of groups they fund.  And, by the way, there are groups associated with education and gay rights as well.

Here are just a few we are familiar with (the dollars in parenthesis are for this one year‚Äì2013!):

Arab Community Center ($100,000)

Casa de Maryland ($270,000)

Center for American Progress ($175,000)

Colorado Immigrant Rights ($360,725)

Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights ($290,000)

Mass. Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition ($210,000)

La Raza ($275,000)

National Immigration Forum ($85,000)

Sojourners ($150,000)

Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition ($469,000)

Welcoming America ($89,000)

The list goes on and on (here).  You might find one in your city or state that you had no idea was even there!

It makes perfect sense. The security guard that was shot became a guard the week before but not for the hotel. He worked for the music event. What was he doing 30 floors up in the hotel? No, he used his uniform to get the guns up the service elevator and when the terrorists shot Paddock, he ran and was gunned down by the elevator. The terrorists then started to shoot up the concert. The FBI is clearly lying to us about what happened and doing a very bad job of it. They are indirectly responsible for this massacre and they are doing everything in their power to hide the fact.

&gt; U. Texas certainly is not alone in dealing with the cultural appropriation nonse‚Äì er, problem; in late summer the University of Michigan advertised a position for someone to enact ‚Äúcultural appropriation prevention activities.‚Äù Salary: $50,000 per year.  

&gt; A year ago at the University of California Merced, students involved in fraternities and sororities were told to avoid using the terms ‚ÄúGreek,‚Äù ‚Äúrush,‚Äù and ‚Äúpledge‚Äù because they ‚Äúappropriated‚Äù Greek culture. Or something.  

&gt; But perhaps the most outrageous reaction to this ‚Äúcultural theft‚Äù occurred at San Francisco State University where a black student attacked a white peer because his hair ‚Ä¶ was in dreadlocks.

The translation of ""Trudeaus"" into English is ""bringers of White Genocide"".

Even the reporting is moronic, having to say the attack was ""unprovoked"".  Come on, a senior citizen was savagely attacked by a muslim animal, of course it was ""unprovoked"".

At the local mosque, built with Saudi money and home to some of those 25,000 Syrian ""refugees"" that Trudeau brought in and settled in that area, they will say it was provoked as to their book it is fine for muslims to kill everyone else.

Canadians will soon be killed off, and various Third World tribes will fight to rule over the broken remains of Canada.  The mathematics says this is inevitable.

All of a sudden a high profile producer has them in his office, you think anything that happened after that wasn't consensual? I bet in some cases, women even threw themselves at him just for a shot at fame. 

The left is also pushing the Rape narrative and everyone in hollywood and the democratic party is slowly turning against him because it preserves the feminist narrative that women are always victims, that even consensual sex is rape if the man is wealthy and powerful, because he MUST have used his wealth and power to get a woman to drop her panties, there is NO WAY women just throw themselves at rich powerful guys, because women are all moral righteous angels who dont need no mans fo nuffin, and not greedy sex and money obsessed whores.

It plays well into their agenda. ""Harvey W was a rapist that was fired and crucified by hollywood yet Donald trump is in the white house"". Watch, next week some pundit will start chatter about removing Donald's hollywood star or rescinding his emmy nominations based on the treatment of Harvey W.

About 2-3 years ago I think it even went into the trending section that a certain account was not being banned, I know there had to have been at least a 1-3 thousand people reporting it for violating the terms and conditions and it took at the very least 12 hours for any action to take place! This was the one time I clicked on the profile and I seen a glimpse of a photo uploaded, the only one to that profile and it was of child pornography, I don‚Äôt remember what I was probably because I‚Äôve erased it from my memory but I remember being disgusted and quickly closing the window, ever since then I‚Äôve made a very conscious effort to go nowhere near anything like that again, even if it is to report a profile, I‚Äôll just send an email to a support team if I can.

Yet I knew personally at least 5-8 people that were banned or suspended off Twitter within an hour for tweeting pro-Trump content and opinions. Amazing.

but really? peyote? IMO everyone should have access to peyote. its not even a dangerous drug lol. its like LSD, anyone without a history of schizophrenia should probably do it once (it doesn't cause schizophrenia, that's a total myth/lie, it only brings it to the surface in cases where people were living on borrowed time and makes it evident slightly earlier than it already would be -- its a pre-existing condition in the individual)

drugs ONLY fall into the same kind of category as the other shit, specifically because they are kept illegal and for no other reason -- obviously, so long as they are illegal people who tend to gravitate towards other illegal acts will be more likely to use them.

but regardless of that, if I left for Amsterdam and smoked weed there (surprise, I'm smoking a bowl here in the US right now! gonna buy more later!!!!) would that be wrong? its not against the law there, and 90% of the world disagrees that its immoral to begin with (and has for over 2000 years. a LOT longer than 2000 years, since like prehistory)

to me this does not work as character assassination of anyone but the people supporting this statement. they/you are the ones with equally poor character.

both demonize their damn opponents. If this guy was like a crack fiend or heroin addict taking public funds to support his addiction, that would be one thing.

but fuck. what people do to their bodies and minds is of no concern to others. fuck the Nazis in this country that started the drug war based on racist lies, and rigging the economy (that's why it was started)

drug users were specifically targeted to crack down on minority opposition politically (wasn't illegal to jail people for being black, Mexican, poor)
the rich have ALWAYS broken these laws, as can be evident in pretty much all literature ever that it was a known open secret. they were also implemented to protect certain powerful economic agencies such as DuPont and pharmaceutical industries from what they see as unfair competition to substances that cannot be patented/controlled/owned by them.

white people used the drugs too -- just in the beginning it wasn't enforced on them, and they had good enough businesses to support use since it was only common among higher class and upper-middle class families until the 60s, when a culture clash happened and lots of youth became associated with smaller minority political groups and the practice expanded.

I'm not saying that he's not a bad guy, or that your wrong. I'm just targeting a specific sub-point you made in the title about peyote.

gimme a break. mescaline is not a big deal. it has few negative side effects, and you cant even have a bad trip on it its so euphoric, its been used in religion for centuries.

maybe being anti-drug gives you some feeling of moral superiority, but this is just an illusion. and its an illusion which keeps a lot of the more serious criminal actions going in the US.

if people stopped looking at it like you, we'd be able to end this fucking DESTINED TO LOSE drug war that CANNOT BE WON EVER without extreme measures of tyranny nobody will be able to accept (i.e. extrajudicial assassination of suspects, constant monitoring on each individual citizen) and even then, the wealthy will be exempt and welcome to 1984 -- where the party does what it wants and anyone else is a slave to their dictations!

as I see it, and as it IS IN REALITY, drugs, especially like Peyote/LSD/Mushrooms, have literally absolutely nothing to do with the other behaviors exhibited by this person. 99% of society would in fact be MORE repulsed by said behaviors while under its influence, and even feel a religious-compulsion to fight against said behaviors.

only a person who was fucked in the head to begin with would ever be such an asshole under the influence without going literally insane with fear and paranoia for like 8-12 hours.

I'm sick of everyone in this damn country, and even everyone in the damn world. Id like to go back several hundred years -- to when enforcement of said opinions was impossible and nobody could do shit about it. the world today is over-regulated, over-enforced, at the personal level IMO.

having all of society from education to culture based off business interests disgusts me. I see talented, intelligent people being left for dead every day because they don't fit the role specified by society, all the while those making the decisions are above the law.

I always said, if you want to make drugs illegal, drug test EVERY CEO, CIO, CISO, and EVERY Politician weekly, and anyone who failed should be imprisoned, fined heavily, and barred from taking the same office again.

but you know why that doesn't happen, and every year senators get busted with coke and shit? (you know, like the conservative guy who wanted to drug test welfare recipients in florida who got busted with shit tons of coke?)

its not a left-right issue, its just one of the issues the right is better about lying about because the left tries to be (slightly) honest in at least publicly approaching the problem (they still lie for corporate and gov't interest, both are evil)

it doesn't happen because the whole system would fall to shit -- quickly people would realize how some people literally are above the law, and the law would no longer apply. Some of us would be out in the streets demanding FULL PARDONS to at least 1/3 of the entire prison population, along with reparations payments (directly from the pockets of those violating the same laws high up)

but nobody wants this. in America your considered fucking privileged to have these positions and wealth. well fuck that. I want UNIFORM ENFORCEMENT ON ALL WHO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

I don't care if that means half the businesses on the NASDAQ go belly up because its leadership becomes imprisoned, and the companies get fined to high hell. I don't care if it means arresting and removing most of congress during their term. I don't care if it meant we would lose a war.

what I want to see is review of existing laws -- honesty about the true reasons they were implemented and an opportunity to remove them from the books no matter what economic chaos would ensue because of it.

sure, I know it will never happen. people won't stop clinging to their biases, or admit their 'heroes' are equally as fallen as those they claim villains. 

but let me tell you -- ive been around socially, and the new generations don't share the same views as you. almost all of them have taken drugs, and still do in secret (although this opiate epidemic on the news has lead to higher enforcement, driving even other drug trades further underground, even a decade ago it was much easier to find non-opioids on campuses and such)

anyone who doesn't have a position of power, or some innate hatred towards anyone who takes a drug based off nothing but illusion, already thinks the drug war is bullshit and non-addictive, safe drugs like peyote should be legal.

If people actually got together and spoke with each other as they do privately with me... youd be surprised what they say.

if people actually didn't feel a social compulsion to agree with cultural norms, youd be surprised that the great majority disagree with those beliefs, and only appear to uphold them to maintain social standing.

that's why anything relating to social standing needs to be protected when it comes to drug use -- people need REAL free speech guarantees (i.e. you cant fire someone for saying they aren't bad, you cant slander them and are FORCED to debate based on FACTS ALONE, often facts NOT DETERMINED by biased federal agencies who lie in their 'research')

but as long as people believe they are under siege for their opinion, they will only ever be honest with people like me who are obviously pro-drug use and who literally don't give a flying f*** if society blacklists them.

I mean, personally I'm of the opinion that if I get blacklisted, I go to war with conventional society. its pretty well known I have extreme beliefs and have reached such a level of being a hermit or exclusion from society I no longer care. to me, there wont be a good job ever, there wont be happiness...

so why should I shut up? what can they do? take the job I wont get away from me? arrest me? go right the fuck ahead. beat me. chop my dick off. I don't care. if I got killed id be pretty happy seeing as I no longer want to live in this world anyways.

so yeah, people are honest with me. people who would lie to their spouses, and never mention what they do/have done to the rest of the world. they know I don't believe it makes them bad people.

drug use is not directly correlated to pedophilia or other serious crimes -- aside from poor people being addicted to crack and heroin -- crimes surrounding these drugs ONLY exist because of their legal status period.

this guy is just capable of getting around the law by being rich enough to avoid persecution within the country -- and also rich enough to go leave to do the drugs in countries where they are legal and come back.

I say, remove the privilege and legalize them here. take away the 'advantage' of being wealthy. make it so that nobody of ANY wealth status level can effectively mount defense when guilty, and so that people of all levels have equitable access..

especially in the case of peyote.

LMAO peyote -- did you guys know there are at least 3 varieties of legal landscaping cacti that contain mescaline in the USA that ARENT endangered like peyote???

you can go on ebay right now and buy dried cactus yourself, in large quantities, and just extract the mescaline yourself. boom -- instant peyote lmao

Opening the door for businesses to discriminate based on ""sincerely held"" religious beliefs might only apply to Christian businesses now, but who's to say in 20-30 years that might not open the door to allow businesses to discriminate based on ""sincerely held"" political beliefs? Leftism has essentially become a religion, and companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google are incredibly left wing already, and control a disproportionate amount of internet traffic and influence. The government rarely gives up the power its given (if ever) so I think we need to be cautious how we deal with these people in the long term. Google, Twitter and Facebook have already shown a propensity to discriminate against conservatives, whether by banning their Twitter accounts while ignoring similar ""ToS"" violations by left wing activists, or by selecting picking trending stories in the case of Facebook. Google has the potential to be more dangerous since it could potentially redirect web traffic away from conservative websites, which would impact ad revenue. ",The_Donald

Social media today gives an agenda spreading platform to those who /wish/ to do harm to another and bypasses due process.  So many times the ""believe them first, trial later"" mentality is at play.  A person can get on social media and say what ever they want about whomever they want w/o repercussion.  This can damage a person's reputation, career, family, etc...

We need to wait this out to see evidence come out if this accusation is infact true.  I could just as very well hop on any medium and say ""Jane/John doe did xyz to me"" and if my credibility was good, I would be believed.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Eminem. The brilliance is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of drug abuse most of the raps will go over a typical listener's head. There‚Äôs also Shady's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Dr. Dre's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these beats, to realise that they‚Äôre not just dope- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Eminem truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Slim‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚Äújust bend over and take it like a slut, okay ma?‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Dr. Dre's epic Fuck da Police. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Marshall Mathers‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ
And yes, by the way, i DO have an Eminem tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably my daughter Hailey) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé",The_Donald

Gifted lyricist. Blistering ignorant on all these issues. 

 Pfft, love our military and country but gives shout out to Krapernick the commie. Hey assholes. Thats not america that needs to answer for these injustices, just the democrats. 

Maragret Sanger,  founded Planned parenthood. Racist AF. Talked about ridding society of the undisreables. The feeble minded and lower classes. Spoke at KKK rallies. Over 75% of abortion clinics are in minority communities. How all the injustices blacks have faced in this country (including slavery) they dont come close to planned parenthood. 16,000,000 black american human fetuses aborted. Why dont you tear down those monuments? Instead youre after Columbus. Atleast the spread of smallpox wasnt intentional. Natives gave us syphilis and tobacco. How many people have died from tobacco? Isnt it strange we never referred to the bubonic plague as asians genocide of europe? Their disease wiped out 1/3 of europe. I guess only the white man and west is to be blamed for the world turning. Interesting. Nevermind there is still slaves throughout the middle east, TODAY. And never mind that inconvenient hate fact that slavery was common practice and africans and muslims sold and used wayyy more slaves than the west ever did. A lot more brutal to boot. As bad as slavery was here, america only had 5% of the slaves and the slave life here was much better. At least they had value. They had to be shipped here after being kidnapped as war loot from conquering african tribes. Native americans had slaves too, numbnuts. Em, you are so brave and really went out on a limb being POLITICALLY CORRECT. What a rebel. 

What about gun control. You mentioned LV. Democrats created gun control to disarm free men/blacks. They went on to lynch almost 6,000 people (1,500 white republicans). All you do is rap about murder, torture and raping your own mother. Youre the epitome of a useful idiot. CNN's perfect viewer. You dont know what youre talking about. You entertain people. Youre a toy. 

You are worried about nuclear war? Fearmonger much? You spineless coward talking about your love for country as rocketman is shooting nukes over our allies heads and into our oceans.

 You spoke of Trump's orange hair. Not your most creative moment. ""The simpsons did it"" comes to mind. You spoke of taxes like this is something you have to even worry about like normal people do. You carry water for mainstream EVERYTHING with your rant. Johnson &amp; Johnson stock doubled overnight from peroxide sales, alone, after slim shady. Marshall Matters, you are the epitome of corporate livestock.  Thx to you, slim shady finally knocked the powdered wig off its throne as the worst hair cut in american history.  

What have you done to help Detroit? Besides give it a bad name and image, Mr. 8mile. It was the democrats who redlined around the now shithole you once called home. How have you used your immense wealth? By normalizing thuggery? Bill Clinton's 3 strikes law locked up a generation of fathers. This hurt the black community more than others. Children need discipline. They crave it and naturally seek it out. They also naturally yearn for protection. Without a father in their home they find it on a corner or in a gang and turn to thug culture for discipline, which you glorify. In fact, case in point. I will however give you credit for sticking around for your daughter. A crazy dysfunctional life, well documented by you, but you obviously love her. But Ike loved Tina as well, so...

Your brilliance as a lyricist will fool a lot of people who have this commie core, post modernist conditioning. You arent a rebel. You arent a freedom fighter. Youre a trans black overseer who has such an ignorant perspective of history and current events, its literally a miracle. To have such a command on the English language but such historical ignorance, you shouldnt even be talking. You speak in incendary ways as if you want another civil war to break out. Remember what happened the last times dems tried to pull this shit. This isnt dems vs republicans. Its america vs socialists/communists and globalists. America will prevail. There will be people from every stripe to make sure it does. This wave of nationalism across the world isnt a freak thing. We are taking our countries back. Hand out all the kool aid you want.

The Santa clause series came out, honestly, the first one was prolly one of the best Christmas movies made, an instant classic. I've watched them yearly since they came out.

He recently did Christmas with the Kranks, a new holiday fav of mine, Hilarious good clean fun movie. If you haven't seen it, it's on netflix, EXCELLENT cast.

 Sometimes, you just want to sit back and watch a clean fun wholesome show or movie, and his history is full of them. It just makes you feel cozy and at home.

Did this dude have this gun deal set up, and cameras set up and shit for some purpose having to do with that, and they figured it out, killed Steven Paddock, the guard hears the shot, responds, is shot at (200 rounds?

It was a sting gone bad because thanks to folks like the awans and brennan and so on there is no opsec.

I do not believe it. 

The incident at the casino in the Philippines that DJT called a terrorist attack makes me think we are being lied to for a change. You all need to look again at that attack and sort the articles in order as they were written and watch the story change and see the similarities between the narrative there and in this case. Give me a break.

If this WAS a sting gone bad (it wasn't - I said the day after the attack that they would claim this - ""at least we were trying to do the right thing"") what kind of moron puts ammo and guns together like that right on top of a perfect kill box? I will tell you who. No one. If this IS SOP we have a real problem of hubris. These people are putting us all at risk with their stupid risk taking bullshit. 

There is no need whatsoever to haul all that ammo up to a buy. NONE.

What are they going to do? cycle a few rounds ? was that ammo special designation? You do not bring along extra gas canisters to the sale of a hot Bentley Continental. I am surprised they aren't claiming he had a pallet of MREs in the room he was selling along with a gross of pull throughs.

Nah man. The ammo was there to use on the people below. I am stunned more people did not die. 

speddit: in the casino attack in the philipines the initial reports speak about a large white man as the attacker.

by the end it has changed into a typical filipino male...with a gambling problem..,that was disgruntled...and his family and everyone else all say the same damn thing...and ISIS claimed it...and US Army Intel. allegedly deny ISIS as does the government...but DJT tweeted it was ISIS...

speddit 2: if this was just a sting gone bad - then explain Chertoff, Soros, Adelson, Murren...you can't. 

speddit 3: then there is the video by Ranty! on youtube where a man that claims to be a vet and has been going around the country helping a friend/boss work these events (reminds me of the Israeli art students going around the US pretending to be on an art tour before they blew the twin towers)  also claimed to have been working on gunshots victims and rushing hither and yon yet he has no indicia of anything whatsoever and...before anyone knew anything about Paddock he says that the shooter was from Mesquite.

I‚Äôm just gonna day the information that i know.

My brother in law is Las Vegas Police and his best friend/my good friend is one of the investigators on the case. It wasn‚Äôt a hotel engineer that was shot. It was a hotel security guard who went up about 20 minutes before the shooting commenced. The shooter had screwed the fire door shut with multiple screws on the floor which had set off some type of alarm in the building (I do not know the security system involved with the door). This set off the flag in the building warranting hotel security staff to go check on the issue. Upon going to the door of the room, the shooter shot approximately 200 rounds through the door at the security officer, hitting him in the leg, and he called for backup immediately after. The shooting then commenced 20 minutes later. The room also had a steel brace across the door on the inside preventing some forms of forcible entry. There was also a food cart outside the room with security cameras ran to the security system he had set up inside the room. 

The multiple shooter thing is a act of a lot of miscommunication. My brother in law is sending me a live recording of the radio chatter throughout the night. I will link that up when I get it. But apparently the multiple shooters were caused from panicked civilians running to these hotels already being shot, calling out that there is a shooter. Prompting on lookers to call for help through 911. Like I said. I‚Äôll get the recording and link it when I can, currently on my phone at work and just wanted to share this information. 

Sorry for any formatting or typos. Just trying to type this out while on a conference call. 

Edit: also i may have missed some information or missed fillingin some blanks. So any questions you need to ask I can probably answer to some extent.",The_Donald

It is homosexuals that like boys 9-14.

This spin about the problem being ""pedophiles"" is false. It was clear at the time what the issue was and the narrative pushed by the media and swallowed by everyone that knows nothing about what the ""lavender.r mafia"" has done. They infiltrated the seminaries, high schools and colleges. Bishops are utterly compromised. 

There is a specific word for the type of ""pedophile"" that is the problem so why are we still using a general term when a specific one is more applicable?

Why does no one want to deal with the simple fact that these priests and bishops after butt fucking young boys butt fuck one another?

Because it is a seamless garment...lol

Every country has a song for their own country. Our government, and its military, keeps you free, builds the roads you drive on, the parks you take your kids to, and more than likely, subsidizes the stadium these guys play in. The US Government PAID THE NFL to host military honors in their stadiums.

It's not in the Government's best interest to fund anything related to the NFL. Viewership is declining because now, even during NFL games, we can't escape people given the opportunity to talk bad about the President of the United States, and bitch about politics. The left leaning media has become 100x more divisive than anything the President has ever said or done.

http://archive.is/TAKHj

If there's a hint of truth to it, God-Emperor needs to fire everyone who isn't a loyalist. Appointing her to a cabinet level position would mean one more vote in favor of invoking the 25th, assuming she's a Kelly loyalist. 

If it's not true, this is yet another example of someone in the Republican Party trying to create a self-fulfilling prophecy where the President cannot trust his most important advisors and as a result becomes paranoid, paralyzed, and unable to govern. 

I'm having such a hard time accepting either of those possibilities. The reporting has been consistent enough across multiple outlets (including ostensibly allied outlets) that I find it unlikely they are just inventing sources out of whole cloth. 

Am I missing any possibilities?

And why can't Trump bring in a bunch of undesignated loyalist advisors to get to the bottom of this after telling them they are prohibited from speaking to the press (which avoids the Mooch or Bannon-like issues).

When I was eight my dad and one his best friends took me and his best friend's kid out fishing in deep water. We came across a stranded small boat with a four person family on board. Dad brought them on board, passed around food and soft drinks (the dad got a beer) and we drove back immediately (never got to fish that day). We spent four hours wandering around looking for Cuban folks who could help them. My dad went to an ATM and grabbed a bunch of money to hand to the family as a van pulled up with a Cuban driver to take the family in (don't know what happened after that). The husband and wife hugged my dad and thanked him.

During the In the 20th century, the ~~Democrats~~ government had continue to pass laws that targeted the poor class such as felonies for possessing simple plants that were favorable among the poor. Nearly 150 years after failing to keep slaves, the ~~Democrats~~ offered sanctuary for human ttraffickers as long as they bring in modern slaves to provide cheap labor. Profit over human rights. Under reign of a ~~Democrat~~ president, the government expanded spying powers on citizens and continued to target and disrupt the poor class by dumping criminals into poor neighbors.

Harvey Weinstein was a BIG player, he was big friends with the Clintons to the point where they move in next to one another and donated massive amounts of money between one another. Outside of this story i don't know where it leads, the griminess of Hollywood is massive, but speaking out against the griminess is career suicide, especially if you are someone in position to be taken advantage of.

The significance of Eminem's comments is that it's another high-profile example of a highly-influential leftist shill promoting the dehumanization of Trump supporters.

I personally didn't like the segment on BET because I'm a fan of his and I perceived it to be pretty fucked up that he'd explicitly call someone's character into question because they support this particular President who, as we know, is in all likelihood the savior of western civilization.

I never gave a shit about the linked song, whether it's ""racist"" or not, and don't now, but the left is currently obsessing over Eminem because he said something anti-Trump and that song seems like a good opportunity to fuck with their identity-politics-driven excuse for a value system if one of them happens to listen to it.

PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: Thank you. It's great to be back here in the Oval Office. As the President said, a lot of things to discuss. We have an incredibly close relationship -- two countries that are interwoven in our economies, cultures, and in our peoples.

But we have a good partnership, and there's always ways to improve it -- always issues we need to talk through. And that's why having an ongoing, constructive relationship between the President and the Prime Minister is really important. And I'm glad to be able to meet with you here again today.

Did she do any research on our nation's laws before she made this tweet? I don't think any one of her fans actually realizes just how insanely hard it would be to do the VERY FIRST STEP. Mueller has been leading a months-long investigation to drum up evidence that Trump is some Manchurian Candidate and still has come up with nothing.

He'd then have to actually get Congressional support to impeach him, then Trump would have to found guilty of...um...I dunno, I guess that's supposed to be sedition? Violating the Emoluments Clause? I don't understand what the crime is supposed to be here, but I guess he's supposed to have committed a crime of which he's then found guilty and removed by the Senate.

Then they'd have to start the whole process all over again with now-President Pence.

Then Ryan would be President, then... NOTHING. There's no ""and then"" here, because that would make Paul Ryan President. By the time the Deep State finished their coup it'd probably be time for a new presidential election anyway, and Clinton would have her chance to prove herself a total loser all over again.

None of this is ever going to happen because our Congress can barely pass a damned budget, let alone double the number of Presidents that have been impeached and not once, but TWICE removing said Presidents from office, a feat which they have not ever done in the history of the United States. Then they would magically, with zero legal justification, call for a special election to deny one of their own members (Paul Ryan) the presidency.

So, while I wish it didn't faze me, if I am being honest, the extent of the insanity and delusion that is so obviously present in so many of my fellow Americans is actually quite disturbing. This is even more appalling as with the vast majority of these people they have no excuse to have become so insane as far as access to education, etc. goes. So, the fact that a good ~20%+ of the US population are LEGITIMATELY nucking futs and have been ""ideologically subverted"" to such a nearly unbelievable extent is truly appalling to me.

The most disturbing aspect of all of this is that this segment of unstable morons, who already struggled with using rational thought to dictate their actions as the majority of them did previously self-identify as ""progressive"" after all, are being blatantly, without cease, whipped up into such a mouth foaming frenzy intentionally by these bought and paid for, beyond irresponsible, propagandists who, for the most part at least, know EXACTLY where this charade will lead society as it really can only end in massive amounts of innocent blood AND YET they continue stoking these flames of delusion!

This really is an effort that at it's core is the very definition of evil and can only be intended to produce distraction after distraction that will crescendo with utter chaos/anarchy and the eventual destruction of civilized society and/or the enslavement/destruction of mankind.

I really do hope those who do still possess their God given mental facilities and yet continue to play their cowardly role of ""useful, sociopathic, idiot"" by riling up the deluded, desperate, and simple realize that w/e form their ""30 pieces of silver"" takes they will NOT be able to enjoy it as their fate is intrinsically tied to the rest of mankind and despite w/e lies it is that they have been sold on that makes them naively believe they will make it out unscathed is 100% dog excrement and that they already have the blood of the inniocent on their hands and if they continue on their course that they will end up with exponentially more to the point they are covered in it.

Even if they impeach both Trump and Pence simultaneously (they'd have to impeach Pence first and then convict and remove both from office before Trump had time to appoint a new Vice-President), it would just mean President Ryan. If they got him too or he refused, we still have Orrin Hatch, Rex Tillerson, Steven Mnuchin (all Republicans) after him. 

The first non-Republican is MAD DOG Mattis (6th in line) who is officially an Independent.

Their best bet would be to win the house back in 2018 and have President Pelosi. But again, this hinges on them winning the senate too, and winning *handily* since even if a handful of deep state establishment ""Republicans"" object to Trump, you'd be hard pressed to make them surrender the presidency to Pelosi over Pence.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Penn pointed out that when Trump dominates the news cycle with strong statements or tweets about his policies he is ‚Äúsavaged as over the top‚Äù by the media. But the president usually ends up winning the underlying policy argument.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Further skewing the polling is the methodology that undergirds them, according to Penn. For instance, they poll ‚Äú‚Äòall adults‚Äô without any qualification as to citizenship or voting intent.‚Äù Some of those polled are nonvoters, and dislike politics and politicians altogether. The polls also include illegal immigrants who are not screened out. Accounting for some of these variables gives a much difference[sic] picture, according to Penn.",The_Donald

The article implies that if he would only stop tweeting, the numbers would skyrocket.   But our POTUS accomplishes objectives with his tweets.  They aren't designed to increase his approval numbers.  They are designed to create debate and discussion for specific reasons, or sometimes just to troll the press.

But the balance of power must have changed, and Weinstein was no longer able to be protected. There are a lot of people in the media that are are legit concerned with sexism and harassment, and this could be a case of them having good motivations in supporting the story--at the New Yorker at least. Their product (old media in general) is on the verge of failing. Maybe they have nothing to lose in supporting some real reporting. It is a very bg deal though--he's not a small sacrifice. It's not just him that's being trashed--the whole narrative is at risk. Hollywood has set itself up as the national conscience and arbiter of (leftist) morality.

In another way, if the story keeps going and the pedo stuff spills out, it all has the feel of the Whore of Babylon being destroyed and shamed. Not saying this is the real deal unfolding, but perhaps an echo of it. These are strange times--so many centers of power are being destroyed.

The Justice Department gave him immunity, and no one was ever prosecuted",1,yir5B,"Paul Combetta, a.k.a. u/stonetear, was one of two Platte River Networks (PRN) employees actively managing Hillary Clinton's private server during her tenure as Secretary of State. 

In July, 2014, the State Department asked Clinton to provide all of her work-related emails, including the e-mails on her private server, as part of an investigation.

On July 24, 2014, **Combetta went to Reddit for help on behalf of his ""VERY VIP"" client, asking how to strip an e-mail address ""from a bunch of archived email(s)...""**. Although it is usually assumed that it was Hillary's address that Combetta wanted to remove, some people speculate that it was actually Obama's. 

When Combetta's Reddit account was discovered in 2016, Combetta deleted his entire post history, along with his account. 

Even though Combetta destroyed evidence and lied to investigators, **the DOJ never rescinded the immunity they granted him in exchange for truthful testimony**. No one was ever prosecuted in relation to Hillary's illegal private server.

Arizona Congressman Gosar is as solid a conservative as there is.  The Establishment Rs tried to gerrymander him out of his own district.  He had to pick up his family, move to his redrawn district and run a primary against their chosen guy.  Gosar won and hasn't looked back.  

Knowing what I know about Charlottesville, the Mayor worked for Soros at one point (who calls Charlotteville the center of the resistance and the organizer of the rally Kessler (also from Charlottesville) who invited the KKK and Nazis to protest the removal of the Lee statue.   But now we know Kessler was an Obama supporter just last year and an Occupy Wall Street guy as well.   I do think this whole thing was a setup by the left to mix the gas and the match.

The brilliance is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of drug abuse most of the raps will go over a typical listener's head. There‚Äôs also Shady's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Dr. Dre's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these beats, to realise that they‚Äôre not just dope- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Eminem truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Slim‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚Äújust bend over and take it like a slut, okay ma?‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Dr. Dre's epic Fuck da Police. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Marshall Mathers‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

And yes, by the way, i DO have an Eminem tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably my daughter Hailey) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé

I didn't get the role and looking back I say ""Thank God almighty"" because had I gotten the role I know I'd be one of Weinstein's victims. And an early movie my uncle took me to see was the first Spider-Man in 2002 which Uncle Ben tells Peter ""With Great power, comes great responsibility."" A phrase I live my life by. So, because my great power is calling out pedos like Weinstein, it is my responsibility to bring him to justice. So I am calling all of us, to find where he is hiding and trying to get GEOTUS to bring him back to America to pay for his crimes.

Here is the letter I sent to my senators and my house rep:

&lt;insert Congress critter name&gt;,

My name is &lt;redacted&gt; and I am a &lt;redacted&gt; resident. As one of your constituents, I am writing to express my concern regarding HR3999 - the bumpfire stock (and all other parts) ban.

This bill is, yet again, an attempt to strip Americans of their Second Amendment Rights. The definition of banned items is so broad that the terms could be applied to just about any firearm part or accessory.

The phrase, ""any device that can increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle"" can be abusively applied to any aftermarket part as the word  ""device"" is not defined.

For example, an aftermarket trigger with a lower pull weight, a very common part, could easily be classified as a device that increases the rate of fire. 

Another massive issue with this bill is that the standard rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle is undefinable. There is no standard rate of fire. A manufacturer may provide a specification for a particular rifle, but this specification is only a generalization based upon the conditions during testing, the ammunition chosen for testing, and most of all the person operating the firearm. There is no standard rate of fire. Therefore, how can it be plausible to charge a lawful firearm owner with a felony if the rifle rate of fire exceeds this undefined and unknown number? 

The Constitution does not give men rights. We are born with these rights from birth. The Amendments prohibit the government from infringing on citizens' natural rights. This bill is a direct attack on Americans' rights, is a flagrant violation of our Second Amendment, and must be struck down.
 
""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

As a member of the legislative branch of the United States Government, it is your responsibility to protect the rights of American citizens. I implore you to vote against this bill. 

Thank you for your time.

&gt;""I suddenly saw that the word 'Allah' [God] had been written in mirrored lettering,"" she says.

Mental gymnastics at its finest!!! Bwhahahahaha! But wait.... it gets better....

&gt;""The pattern suggests Ali is being equated with Allah, and therefore there is a slim possibility it has some connection to very early, extreme, mystical fringe movements who believed in this

&gt;""But more likely it is a wrongly copied pattern.""

Wait, what? 

So, the teeney weeney, tiny, unknown geometric pattern.... that kinda looked like some spanish geometric patterns..... which when enlarged and flipped around supposedly looks like 'Allah'.... that doesn't makes sense because it equates allah with another muslim.... is probably 'a wrongly copied pattern'?

Am I getting that right?

And to finish it off...

If the Russia investigation would be truly about finding real collusion, or treason and not about desperately creating a with-hunt story to discredit our God Emperor and savior Trump, then Awan family would be already behind bars, since before the election. 

My guess is like Anon's, too many corrupt politicians, law enforcement and intelligence agency members involved in illegal activities (from laundry to pedophilia). And Imran had probably enough access to get up a 'life insurance' folder, like Anthony.

He also worked for several others during his employment.
The job of Congress is to make laws. In order to make laws, they need information.

They also are the government body that funds the government. They spend the money. In order to do this, they need information. Lots and lots of information.
Think about it.  
Want to fund a military? You will need to know what we have now and what are plans are for the future. 
Something as seemingly innocuous as how many boots we order is valuable information. 
Information is the most valuable commodity.
Awan has access to that information since 2008.  
For those of you who believe this is a problem for only the democrats, you are wrong. He had access to House systems which include everyone. 

So, ever donate to the DNC or any candidate? Did you do it electronically?
What are the chances that information was sold to someone in Pakistan?

You might think the Russians hacked the DNC. You might be thinking it was Seth Rich. Or it could it be an IT specialist from Pakistan who sold it for cash? 

Always always remember that it wasn‚Äôt the fact that someone stole the DNC data that did them in, it was that it proved that the DNC rigged the Democratic primary.

The fact that our electoral system is run by two private entities (RNC and DNC) is a bit disconcerting, but that‚Äôs another thread.

(Gun people),3,NECC_EOD,"Maybe I can offer perspective, as Naval EOD we deploy often with SEALS so we are trained to a standard to match their combat lethality. I was tasked to SEAL team 4 my entire time in Afghanistan a total of three years. Assigned to varioua operations ranging from RRT to CSAR, we seldom would ever rock full auto unless you're running the SAW. 

Full auto fire has such a limited use regulated to either suppression or overwhelming fire used to engage or retreat from ambush situations, squad leaders will often use full auto with tracer ammunition to mark targets outside of this it's seldom used.

A bump stocked weapon would be harder to control, it's impossible to achieve a constant cyclic rate this will keep the operator from adjusting to the recoil. Bipod mounted or not this issue will be present.

The caliber is also important, anything above .223 or 5.56mm would be not only inaccurate but recoil would without a bipod be virtual impossible for more than 3 round bursts. To use it with a bipod would be so punishing to the operator to make it viable..

This is why the M14 was replaced with the M16, the 7.62mm NATO carries too much recoil. 

The Vegas shooter likely knew this, he pre ranged soft cover and choke points, opened up with a bump stocked AR in .223 then switched to one of the bipod mounted .308 weapons in semi auto to pick off targets repeated back and forth..

The optics on the .308 rifles are not practical for full auto fire, they also appear to have 5-10 round magazines..

f605f83d-c10f-417c-8437-2b07b6468413,Islamic Scholar Nails 40 Theses of Reformation onto Door of Berlin Mosque [Article in German],1,JDFidelius,"First paragraph translated by me:

&gt;A Martin Luther of Islam? In the year of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's reformation, the Islamic scholar and religious educator Abdel-Hakim Ourghi, of Freiburg, has nailed 40 theses of Islamic reformation to the door of a mosque in Berlin. On Saturday morning, Ourghi stapled his theses of a humanistic, peaceable Islam onto the door of the Dar Assalam Mosque (""Community Meeting Place of Neuk√∂lln [a suburb of Berlin]""). The founder of the liberal Ibn Rushd Goethe Mosque, which is also located in Berlin, presented his book titled ""Reform of Islam. 40 Theses"" the day before.

Later on in the article, the scholar states:

&gt;In reality, the West should be our rulers [not the other way around]


I would also like to highlight some of the theses that he wrote.

&gt;#1. It is time for a European Islam
&gt;#5. The heritage of Islam must be able to be researched freely
&gt;#13. Islam is not a universal religion, as the Quran is a religious document addressed to the Arabs
&gt;#17. To err is human; the Prophet himself had erred
&gt;#32. No religion is in possession of absolute truth, and no human has the key to paradise
&gt;#34. The hijab is not a religious requirement, but an historical product from the rule of men
&gt;#36. Islam does indeed have to do with Islamism
&gt;#37. Unreformed Islam is *not* a religion of peace

Some commentary on the theses:  thesis 17 strikes at the core of the current belief systems of Islam, which is that Mohammed could not err. As such, policy and social beliefs are informed by the notion that Mohammed could do no wrong, so anything that the prophet did, should be allowed. We see the conflict with the modern world that this belief has when considering Mohammed's child wife, Aisha; doing away with the simplistic notion that a human prophet cannot err would allow Islam to be united with the modern world.

Thesis 32 is very liberal, and typically a view adapted by atheists, agnostics, and followers of more modern religions. I do not believe that any feasible version of reformed Islam would carry this view.

Thesis 36 and 37 strike against the liberal narrative that Islamic extremism has nothing to do with mainstream Islamic beliefs, and the notion that Islam is a religion of peace. In order for Islam to be adapted to the modern world, its scholars must first openly admit and condemn the many passages that call for violence against nonbelievers and sinners alike.

&gt; Do you have any concerns about ""skeletons"" in his closet?

None. In fact, I think people expect he's done a lot of reckless things in the past. He wouldn't deny it. He'd own it. Short of actual hidden dead hookers or underage prostitutes I don't think anything he did will be a liability. The people of Michigan know who he is and they love him. And with good reason. He's talked about his love for the state and it's people his whole career (may get to a clip or two on this below). He's also done significant philanthropy in Detroit and elsewhere. Basically, he's put his money and time where his mouth has been and his mouth has been in Michigan.



&gt; or have the ""Left"" use him and his history as some political weapon.. which, if we are being honest, we both know they will.

Ok, let's start with why this wont be a problem and the moment he won my full support (had been looking into his politics prior because I didn't want another RINO)

[Here is the article](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/13/kid-rock-senate-run-comments/103678072/). It's worth a read but when Stabenow asked for comment on a potential run by Ritchie she said something about conceding he was better at playing guitar than her but that she'll keep fighting for the people of Michigan. Ritchie's response: ‚ÄúI concede she is better at playing politics than I am so I'll keep doing what I do best, which is being a voice for tax paying, hardworking AMERICANS and letting politicians like her know that We the People are sick and tired of their bull----!‚Äù


Sold. Right then and there. 

His response to any comments about his past will be, ""My opponent wants to make this race about my past. I'm making it about you, the people of Michigan."" And she's BTFO

&gt; I will listen to him speak and do some reading...(If you have links or anything specific I should read/watch or listen to, I will). 

I can point you a direction but I really do encourage people to do their own research. You can start with [this article](https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/07/18/kid-rock-for-senate-look-at-musicians-political-past.amp.html) from foxnews. Next I would point you to [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u6ZV2IHyQIA) interview with Charlie LeDuff. If you don't know who Charlie LeDuff is that's okay. But the people in Michigan do. Next you can check out [this article](http://freebeacon.com/politics/kid-rock-leads-new-michigan-senate-poll/amp/) that shows he was leading in hypothetical polls against Stabenow (two separate polls had him leading and by a large amount). 


From there, just look how many bricks are being shat from all the left wing columnists and journalists. The Hill, Slate, Vox and more have all ran hit pieces. Also notice how the polls have changed (cough* 98.1% cough* Hillary could even win Texas cough* cough*)


&gt; do you think he would be more effective continuing to MAGA as he is, or as a Senator?

Now they're paying the price.""",1,Sususu77,"&gt;But the terms of the clash were always more complicated. In sidelining Hill and threatening to bench players who crossed the President, the network and league, respectively, handed him the kind of win he thirsts for so desperately -- one that leaves his opponents humiliated.
And exposed.

&gt;Giving in to Trump will not earn the NFL and ESPN a reprieve. Quite the opposite. If anything, their apparent weakness will only invite further attacks. As the Republican establishment can attest, Trump and his allies do not, seeing their power grow, let up and move on. (This is a familiar rule to anyone who routinely deals with internet trolls.)

üòÇüëå

&gt;But it was too late. Trump may be badly hobbled in Washington, DC, but he is no less an astute manipulator of public opinion. The NFL and ESPN, like so many presidential candidates last year, reacted to Trump's attacks with tactics drawn from a bygone era.

She of course lost. McCabe reportedly was heavily involved in the Clinton investigation and helped make sure it never went anywhere.

One of the most obvious cases of bribing a law enforcement official I've ever seen.

The only theory that really makes sense, and is good for us, is that McCabe knows that they've got him by the fucking balls. Sure, he's part of the swamp. But if you've got dirt on the guy, and can make him work for you against the swamp, why not? Maybe he was straight-up told, ""Listen McCabe, you and your wife will go to fucking jail for ten years if you don't do what needs to be done when the day of the indictments comes for Hillary and her pals. Understand?""

If you've got leverage on the guy like that, why waste it by firing him? Why blow your wad and convict him? Better to FLIP him.

Is it possible that they could have smelled gun powder within seconds of the first shots if the only shooter was at the Mandalay? Early on there were reports of shooters at the concert venue. People smelling gunpowder would seem to confirm another shooter. On the other hand it could be false memory created by the ""fog of war.""

They lost their chance at having a left leaning SCOTUS. They are losing Federal Judgeships hand over fist. They can scream about the 2A and Impeachment all they want but don't have the votes.

He has been systematically working through the enemies of the American people Foreign and Domestic.When was the last time you heard about Syria? That was coming to a head with Russia last year.

Stagnant economy now growing.

Now he, and Bannon, are working on the most dangerous enemy of all, the GOP.

They will fight over gay marriage, but do nothing to defend the border.
The 'free trade' fundamentalism is only used to ensure their globalist buddies and donors can bleed America dry. Not wanting to step in to help businesses only serves to hasten that.
I could be wrong.
There surely is more to ideological conservativism, but it seems like it is just used for convenience of the globalists agenda.

Its been shown the Delonge has government connected ""witnesses"", but they're basically telling him that the government are the good guys and all the aliens are the bad guys.

There's also another guy named Steven Greer that's been in this area for a while as well.  What he puts out is that the government is bad and all aliens are good.  I'm not sure what to think.  If anyone still has netflix he has a documentary on there called Unacknowledged that just came out.  He and others have claimed that if the elites think they're starting to lose their power then they can hoax a fake alien invasion, look up project bluebeam.

An interesting video I saw is of a researched named Grant Cameron and he says that while the UFO stuff is real, these people with government sources are being lied to, but bits and pieces of what they release are true.  He thinks the whole phenomenon is tied into consciousness itself and if you read any UFO stories, then that makes a lot of sense, assuming this is true.

Most of this stuff I know I've just read on reddit and watched a lot of youtube videos.  Not in anyway proof of anything, just interesting information.  Even more interesting when the podesta emails came out.

Edit: Here's the Cameron video, he seems to be a Hillary supporter but not anti-trump.  Hes more into getting disclosure and thought she was a better choice just for that.

When you assume there's good, you assume there's such a thing as a moral law on the basis of which to differentiate between good and evil.

Here is the letter I sent to my senators and my house rep:

&lt;insert Congress critter name&gt;,

My name is &lt;redacted&gt; and I am a &lt;redacted&gt; resident. As one of your constituents, I am writing to express my concern regarding HR3999 - the bumpfire stock (and all other parts) ban.

This bill is, yet again, an attempt to strip Americans of their Second Amendment Rights. The definition of banned items is so broad that the terms could be applied to just about any firearm part or accessory.

The phrase, ""any device that can increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle"" can be abusively applied to any aftermarket part as the word  ""device"" is not defined.

For example, an aftermarket trigger with a lower pull weight, a very common part, could easily be classified as a device that increases the rate of fire. 

Another massive issue with this bill is that the standard rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle is undefinable. There is no standard rate of fire. A manufacturer may provide a specification for a particular rifle, but this specification is only a generalization based upon the conditions during testing, the ammunition chosen for testing, and most of all the person operating the firearm. There is no standard rate of fire. Therefore, how can it be plausible to charge a lawful firearm owner with a felony if the rifle rate of fire exceeds this undefined and unknown number? 

The Constitution does not give men rights. We are born with these rights from birth. The Amendments prohibit the government from infringing on citizens' natural rights. This bill is a direct attack on Americans' rights, is a flagrant violation of our Second Amendment, and must be struck down.
 
""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

As a member of the legislative branch of the United States Government, it is your responsibility to protect the rights of American citizens. I implore you to vote against this bill. 

Thank you for your time.

The press for instance, should not be able to get away with calling for genocide or inciting others to commit crimes. Just like with freedom of speech where you don't have the right to incite people to attack someone physically, the press doesn't either. What they've done in not only positively covering, but inciting violence against Trump supporters and average Americans should be looked into. 

Another argument is that they should lose their news license if they purposely distort and falsify the truth. The problem with this is, who gets to decide whether they are doing this? While it would be nice if CNN had to put a disclaimer up that they are an advocacy group and not news, what would stop the next Democrat from simply flipping that on any conservative outlets? 

If 500,000 idiots want to watch CNN and get their daily slurping of fake news I say let them. So long as they are not inciting political violence I see no harm (which they are currently.) CNN does more harm to it's own brand every single day then an investigation into them would do. ",The_Donald

I went to college across the country and Dave did his thing.  Twice a year a group of us gets together, Dave has never missed a trip and they wouldn't be the same with out him, I've done some crazy stuff, but you can always count on Dave to take it to the next level.  He is everyones best friend - even if you just met him or have known him for 30 years...  Despite my love and admiration for Dave.. He wouldn't be on my short list if I was looking for a business partner, or needed financial advice...  If that makes sense.  I see a lot of Dave in Kid Rock..

My impression was that this guy knows what he is talking about in terms of logic and math; however, it all relies on his initial analysis of the audio files being correct and I really saw no evidence or good reason to believe that in this video. A proper method still gives a wrong answer if you feed it the wrong data, and this guy admits he's not an expert at audio analysis and only putting forth the common sense basic physics understanding of data that he assumes he interpreted correctly. A proper method still gives a wrong answer if you feed it the wrong data. 

The only way to verify this is to actually find all the videos and try to recreate what he claims to have created. If you can in fact distinguish two consistent and different lag times from those videos, and we confirm that the known shooter only used one caliber shot at one speed by similar weapons, then I would be inclined to agree with him that we have evidence of two different shooters/locations. This video however provides zero reason for me to believe that his analysis of the sounds was correct. 

All videos I've seen have been shitty and mostly filmed on cell phones with garbage microphones, what reason do I have to believe that his lag time calculations are actually right? He says he accounted for echos, but how do we know he did that properly? If he's being entirely honest and is so confident he's right why didn't he release the isolated audio files so we could easily verify for ourselves? Why doesn't he describe the methods he used to identify the sounds he uses for his calculations?

We need other people to confirm/deny the his initial analysis. If we can confirm the lag time differences then I'd start to believe his conclusion. For all I know he used two recordings that were from phones 250 yards apart and that's literally the entire reason that two different lag times exist. ",The_Donald

So they use words like bullshit, racist, crazy and insane to discourage anyone listening from acknowledging good points made by their opposition.

I have one child, a 9 yr old daughter. 

The Girls Scouts, IMHO, cater to a 1950's June Beaver view of the American woman. 

T_D loves strong women that defend and conserve the premise of the American Revolution. 

My daughter loves 'How To' books from everyday things to survival. She frequently checks out BSA merit badge books from the library. 

She has her own suppressed MP15-22, she is able to tear it down and clean, nice grouping at 160yds with iron sights. 

So, from a different perspective, I've always thought that she was at a distinct disadvantage of not being able to be in the BSA. Valid, real. 

I'm not real sure I agree with a bunch of the bias here. If you have a daughter AND disagree with me, I'd like to hear you out. 

I think the next gen will be at war with the fascist state, whether inside our nation or abroad. The Boy Scouts are a bedrock of leadership training and offer in depth instruction for American ideals. Putting the gender issues to the side, I believe the program integration will yield a stronger America. Saying that, there needs to be a girls team and a boys team, separate Dens/Patrols, Packs/Troops. Btw, I'm still letting this sink in. I may change my mind. ",The_Donald

Girls are already in the BSA, officially. Girls from 14+ can be in the BSA Venture program, this is where a lot of the boys who make Eagle go to further their Scouting adventures. So its already a co-ed program. This means that our camps and events for older Scouts already can accommodate both sexes with sleeping/bathroom etc.

Girls in Cub Scouts, its already there. Cub Scouts is a family program. When we go camping, entire families come. When we have Den/Pack meetings, siblings are there. Sisters and younger boy siblings already participate in pack/den/camp activities. The only difference is that they are not registered as a cub scout like their brother.

The reason it is important to register the girls,  INSURANCE. The cub scouts parents can be registered, the cub scout is registered, and they are all covered by our insurance. Sisters are NOT covered because there is no way they can be registered in the program.

Cub scouts differs from Girls Scouts because Cub Scouts is for entire family (camping/activities). Girl Scouts, only the registered leaders are camping/meetings/activities.

National has come up with a very good idea with how to incorporate the girls into more programs in the Boy Scouts, beyond Venture Scouts. Having same sex Cub Scout Dens and a separate female only program for the older girls doesn't really impact the boys experience. The boys are still allowed to be boys and the girls can be girls. They are not mixed anymore than they already are unofficially.


We are one of the only Scouting programs in the world that doesn't allow both genders. Scouting works all over the world, it can work like this here too.


Our membership is already in decline, due to the issues you guys are talking about here.. its not PC to be Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent. We respect our military, police, first responders and our flag. We value religion and its part of our core program. We teach out scouts respect for firearms and how to use them safely. Bringing these values to young men and women should be celebrated, encouraged and supported.

The skills from BSA would be useful for all kids to learn, so it would be good to get the girl scouts away from organizations that teach harmful behavior and ideology.

The reason I'm still not positive it's a good idea though, is that I'm almost positive that the benefits of the BSA could he eroded if/when liberal women scout leaders try to squeeze in and force a liberal agenda.

I don't think it's a crazy concern, especially if GSA membership is down when girls would rather join a group doing fun things (it's well known GSA is boring as shit) so the GSA leaders might try to be leaders in the BSA and mold it to fit their agenda. ",The_Donald

The boy scouts teaches values that should be universal among sexes: honor, integrity, preparedness, as well as valuable life skills such as: knot tying, first aid, archery, basic auto maintenance, fishing, tent staking and so on.

If I had a daughter who wanted to to be taught these kinds of things I would be thrilled, and she would be a better citizen and more well rounded person for it.

As far as I'm aware beyond having ""boy/girl"" in their names the two scouts organizations have wholly different curriculum's - so its not fair to say that girls should simply go to the girl scouts - if they wouldn't learn remotely the same things.

Would you all be happier if the Boy Scouts were simply renamed ""The Scouts""? If so - whats in a name? If not - can you give me a practical reason why it should be a sex exclusive club?",The_Donald

It s like taking down Cosby with allegations because he tokd black kids they were responsible for their own lives.

Its like going after Trump because he joked he could cop a feel and the women liked beciase he was a celebrity (which every rock star and celebrity in history knows is true. Many many women want sex with celebrties no matte rwhat angry ugly lesbian SJW's say)

They are trying to make men liking women sexually be a bad thing.

Thats the problem with the weinsiten narrative. Yeah he is a fat ugly mess. But i havent hearda thing about him raping anyone. Yet they are trying to say a man just propostioning a woman is bad.

Hollywood today is full of sickos but it isnt the fat dudes propositioning grown women who say no that are the problem.

Yeah weinstein fits some funny narratives that arefun to throw in the face of hollywood but be careful what you are blaming him for because ..unless something worse comes out that we havent heard yet... The thing everyone is blaming him for is liking women. And that isnt wrong. And I am not going to fall into that SJW trap with weinstein any more than I did with Trump.

And I am no shill.


If you want to attack hollywood go after those producers and studio heads that fill their pools with underage boys and all the others that go to their parties.

Weinstein is a fat ugly guy but he is still just doing some guy stuff. 

Unless he is forcing women to sleep with him which NO ONE has claimed he is then them just getting offended because he asked isnt wrong.

I fact most of these actresses claiming to be offended woukd have been happy to sleep with him if ue had been good looking.

Perhaps what we really should be going after in the weinstein thing is the hypocritical actresses who are silently fat shaming Weinstein. Now THAT would be an interesting and funny angle.",The_Donald

You are paying this professional to do a job for you. If you feel that this person is not doing his/her job properly, see if there is a legal aid service in your area and seek advice from them. I'm not saying to obtain services from them, but maybe someone there can better explain how to deal with situations such as yours and/or lead you to support groups or online resources that could be helpful.

Secondly, and I'm not trying to compound your worries, your ex may be experiencing some sort of post-partum depression. I know nothing about this, but it may be worth looking into. I would assume, though, that your attorney would consider this. If the ex is experiencing post-partum depression, she needs to be seeking help.

On a spiritual note, you and your family should pray for a miracle. God is in the business of handling miracles. Tell God that all of this is more than you can bear and that you need help. He may or may not work things in the manner you want, but He will work them for the good of your life in the long run. That is where faith comes in‚Äîbelieving and accepting that God knows best and will provide for you and comfort you during good times and bad. 

Also, please consider that your emotions are riding high right now, and rightly so. Do not, however, allow your emotions to get the better of you and cloud your thinking. Accept them for what they are‚Äîreactions that come and go. Do not let your own or anyone else's negative opinions of who you are overwhelm you. They are false. Sure, we all have our bad points but we have good ones as well. Discover and list what those are, no matter how minute you may consider them. There is much more value in the quality of your heart than in any material achievement/success. 

My dad died when I was 13. I have always tried to tell myself that wasn't some major disaster that I grew up without a father; that a lot of children grow up without fathers. But there is something missing from my life whether I want to admit it or not. There was no strong adult male role model in my life. So, for your daughter's sake, concentrate on the good in yourself and all that you have to offer her now and throughout her entire life. God is using this situation now to help develop you into the father that your daughter needs now and will need in her future. Look to Him for comfort and guidance each day.

Prayers up, Pede!",The_Donald

Pennsylvania's Secretary of State office is also supposed to investigate licensing violations of any sort. This guy served as Rendell's SoS for 7-1/2 years (the longest SoS in the history of PA) but left abruptly in June 2010 when Rendell had just 7 months left in his term. His Wikipedia gives no explanation for it nor can I find any info about what he was doing from then until Wolf brought him back in 2015.


However, I believe Gosnell's unsanitary abortion clinic that killed a few women as well as hundreds of babies born alive after botched abortions was shut down in Feb/Mar 2010.That investigation uncovered that Cortes' office had received *countless* complaints about Gosnell's clinic and never investigated a single one. Never even called the clinic to ask a few questions, nothing at all. Assuming that's why he left Rendell's administration so close to the end without just waiting it out.


Cortes' low-key employment after leaving Rendell's administration was at some bullshit company called *Everybody Counts* which creates technology to vote via the internet and over the phone.


Guessing his expertise in ways to facilitate voter fraud is why Wolf wanted him since that's the #1 priority of the Democratic party. Otherwise why would a Gov appoint a cabinet member who failed to fulfill even the most basic minimum duties of his office under a prior administration?

What are equality camps? Well, let me describe some advantages to you:

Equal opportunity to work (all day).

Equal housing (barracks/cells).

Maximum diversity (Communist degeneracy knows no boundaries).

Equal punishments.

Equal food (slop).

Equal education (learn how to work your machine).

Equal medical care (enough to keep them useful).

Equal gun rights (government only gets guns).

Equal mass surveillance.

Equal sexual orientation diversity (degenerates are degenerates).

Most importantly: Equal opportunity to serve their nation as the *WORKERS* Part(y) of America!

He told Lib√©ration: ""It's right to struggle, but when you confront an American distributor like Weinstein, not to name names, there is not much you can do. **Either you say, 'Go figure it out with your pile of shit' or you brace yourself so the blackmail isn't as violent ‚Ä¶ If I don't sign, that's where the out-and-out blackmail starts**, but I could go that far. There are two versions of the film for now: mine and his ‚Ä¶ which I find catastrophic.""",The_Donald

Now in the bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before during or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids, in a more derogatory way
But who's to say, what's fair to say
And what not to say
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre (What up?), I got a question if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (Yeah)
But, up I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hut-hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay
I just need to clear things up

Here is the letter I sent to my senators and my house rep:

&lt;insert Congress critter name&gt;,

My name is &lt;redacted&gt; and I am a &lt;redacted&gt; resident. As one of your constituents, I am writing to express my concern regarding HR3999 - the bumpfire stock (and all other parts) ban.

This bill is, yet again, an attempt to strip Americans of their Second Amendment Rights. The definition of banned items is so broad that the terms could be applied to just about any firearm part or accessory.

The phrase, ""any device that can increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle"" can be abusively applied to any aftermarket part as the word  ""device"" is not defined.

For example, an aftermarket trigger with a lower pull weight, a very common part, could easily be classified as a device that increases the rate of fire. 

Another massive issue with this bill is that the standard rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle is undefinable. There is no standard rate of fire. A manufacturer may provide a specification for a particular rifle, but this specification is only a generalization based upon the conditions during testing, the ammunition chosen for testing, and most of all the person operating the firearm. There is no standard rate of fire. Therefore, how can it be plausible to charge a lawful firearm owner with a felony if the rifle rate of fire exceeds this undefined and unknown number? 

The Constitution does not give men rights. We are born with these rights from birth. The Amendments prohibit the government from infringing on citizens' natural rights. This bill is a direct attack on Americans' rights, is a flagrant violation of our Second Amendment, and must be struck down.
 
""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

As a member of the legislative branch of the United States Government, it is your responsibility to protect the rights of American citizens. I implore you to vote against this bill. 

Thank you for your time.

They are absolutely hiding *something* but that doesn't mean it's not for valid reason. There's plenty of valid reasons not to release information about an ongoing investigation. Conspiracy theories tend to rely too heavily on intelligent organized actors and not the much more common answer of incompetence and selfishness. 

Most conspiracies can be reasonably explained by a combination of a few bad/selfish actors, a shitty situation, and a healthy dose of incompetence by multiple parties. Keep in mind Trump has the power to declassify anything he wants to if he thinks the people need to know, and he's far from someone that keeps quiet on important issues just because it might upset someone. If it was as simple as ""it was ISIS but the media loves ISIS"" he'd either tell us himself or be tweeting out about the investigation. He's stayed silent so either he knows the investigation is honest and ongoing or he's got a bigger plan in action that must remain secret.",The_Donald

The brilliance is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of drug abuse most of the raps will go over a typical listener's head. There‚Äôs also Shady's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Dr. Dre's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these beats, to realise that they‚Äôre not just dope- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Eminem truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Slim‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚ÄúAnd how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Dr. Dre's epic Fuck da Police. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Marshall Mathers‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

And yes, by the way, i DO have an Eminem tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé

The Access Hollywood tape is of Trump talking about the nature of celebrity. ""When you are a star you can do anything... grab them by the pussy...""

Trump says he is automatically attracted to beautiful women (which is normal, as is a guy liking a guy, a woman liking a woman, or an old woman liking a younger man, I don't judge love - that's legal).

At no point does Trump indicate he has done this, and there are no claims that he has. One can point to the rape accussers, however, I only ask, where are they now? With Weinstein being in the press, it seems these women should be empowered to come forward, however they have not.

I belive those accuser's where political folly. If I am wrong, they need to come forward again and go to court, otherwise I base my opinion on the facts at hand.

The full audio is here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcZcTnykYbw 

Lets compare that to Weinsteins audio...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cXp8q2BoII

In this audio, we can hear Weinstein doing what Trump talked about, celeb privilege. Weinstein feels he has this privilege, however the woman does not. So it becomes nonconsensual.

In this audio of Weinstein he is doing way worse than what Trump talked about. This is not celeb privilege, this is sexual harassment, bordering on assault. In other cases we are hearing of rape and assault, but in this audio it only shows the sexual harassment, and physical intimidation.

I would only say that we all know of celeb privilege, we all have all talked about who our wife or girlfriends celeb crush is, and we play the game of a freebie if the occasion arises. We all know about groupies. We know that celebs, ugly, nonwitty, or not get access to the other sex, ore so if they were not famous, or rich. Gold diggers is a term. So are sugar daddy's and sugar momma's.

I have no problem with celebs using this to get laid. However, it becomes problematic when this privilege is used in a workplace environment (fuck me for a part), or when the woman says no. Then is become illegal.

Trump spoke of celeb privilege, Weinstein abused celeb privilege by allegedly raping and assaulting women. Massive difference, and nearly incomparable.

But in the end they're admitting that being rich and famous was more important, in the long run, than saying no to a creepy producer.

The brilliance is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of drug abuse most of the raps will go over a typical listener's head. There‚Äôs also Shady's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Dr. Dre's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these beats, to realise that they‚Äôre not just dope- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Eminem truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Slim‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚Äújust bend over and take it like a slut, okay ma?‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Dr. Dre's epic Fuck da Police. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Marshall Mathers‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

And yes, by the way, i DO have an Eminem tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably my daughter Hailey) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé

It's when a white male tries really hard to impress their black friends but goes too far. Let's face it, it feels good when a black person compliments you if you're white. Compliments in general are good but there's something special about that. Some unfortunate whites get addicted to that feeling and start wiggering out or throwing up a black power salute etc. Enjoy the BR, never get drunk on BR.",The_Donald

I went to shows, knew my local scene and whatnot. I was against the the system and the people that abused it to their own agenda and not the peoples. Now kids today in hardcore/punk are largely anti trump, and want to be real nazi bashers because the mainstream media promoted it so much, and promote they try to promote unity in the scene by doing so, without even considering that nazi culture is more related to hardcore/punk. Ever heard of a jazz-nazi, or heard of a nazi show happening in the hip hop scene? Most are very uninvolved in getting to know the political field they exaist in. Most don't even actually care about the political field, and just like being against whatever is current because it makes them FEEL like their against the curve, but in all reality don't understand that being punk/hardcore today is just clinging onto preset anti culture that's already been sold to stores, and the ideas have worn off since it originated. Some kids promote their inner punk by going edge and not drinking or smoking, and forget that Trump is 100% relatable by being successful in life by not drinking or smoking. A lot of my friends today tell me I've basically become an old man because I don't party and work all the time. But when I see them they just complain about life and how it sucks, and I'm in my mid 20's and I feel like my life's gotten nothing but better since I put my personal economic well being before my personal spirit, which allowed me to see what I was really capable of in life, instead of worrying about staying in a rock and roll lifestyle until I die with no savings.

Look at the 60s....oooo hippie fashion and tie dyed shirts for all...look at the 90s....doc martens and flannels for all.  Music and subculture became to powerful so they market it, rebrand it, and sell it to teener boppers who parrot its meanings and drown out the true message.  

They will try to do this to us, mark my words.  Once they start losing to much and they get scared enough...all our Pepe's and hats will start to become strangely popular.  Politicians, media, celebs will just start to say what we want to hear.

It's gonna happen, if it isn't already and we have to be ready and never lose sight of the substance of what it is we stand for.",The_Donald
