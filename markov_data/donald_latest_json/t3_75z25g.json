As one of your constituents, I am writing to express my concern regarding HR3999 - the bumpfire stock (and all other parts) ban.\n\nThis bill is, yet again, an attempt to strip Americans of their Second Amendment Rights. The definition of banned items is so broad that the terms could be applied to just about any firearm part or accessory.\n\nThe phrase, \"any device that can increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle\" can be abusively applied to any aftermarket part as the word  \"device\" is not defined.\n\nFor example, an aftermarket trigger with a lower pull weight, a very common part, could easily be classified as a device that increases the rate of fire. \n\nAnother massive issue with this bill is that the standard rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle is undefinable. There is no standard rate of fire. A manufacturer may provide a specification for a particular rifle, but this specification is only a generalization based upon the conditions during testing, the ammunition chosen for testing, and most of all the person operating the firearm. There is no standard rate of fire. Therefore, how can it be plausible to charge a lawful firearm owner with a felony if the rifle rate of fire exceeds this undefined and unknown number? \n\nThe Constitution does not give men rights. We are born with these rights from birth. The Amendments prohibit the government from infringing on citizens' natural rights. This bill is a direct attack on Americans' rights, is a flagrant violation of our Second Amendment, and must be struck down.\n \n\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nAs a member of the legislative branch of the United States Government, it is your responsibility to protect the rights of American citizens.
