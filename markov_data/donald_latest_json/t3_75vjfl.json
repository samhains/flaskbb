Not sure what it is about the human mind that needs that spiritual fulfillment, but the void must be filled with something, be it a god or gods, yourself, or the State.\n\n\n\nIt's what happened in the Soviet Union when they took religion away from people, they treated the State as the moral authority. Whatever they said was a fundamental truth, and any who denied it was to be given over to them and killed. Hitler was trying to edge the German populace onto that, or at least something akin to North Korea, as he had already integrated himself into official prayers for the Hitler Youth. Before long, they would have phased out God entirely and they'd be praying to Hitler. Part of that was further mimicry of the Roman Empire, as the Romans believed their emperors to be gods just as much as they believed in Zeus or Hades. Hitler would have taken that role, but minus the paganism.\n\n\n\n\nDeifying the State also has the consequence of what you mentioned: no higher moral authority. Let's compare and contrast two nearly identical moments in history. On one side, we have the French Army at the Nivelle Offensive in World War 1. On the other side, we have the Red Army throughout World War 2. The disparity in the length of these two actually helps to strengthen it, as you'll see.\n\n\n\nSimply put, the Nivelle Offensive was an attempt by the French High Command to break through the thick German defensive line at the French-German border. Officers were given orders to shoot any men attempting to retreat, and the soldiers themselves were marched straight into machine gun fire in an attempt to use superior numbers to overwhelm them. The result of the single battle was widespread mutiny. Many men killed their officers and tried to overthrow the French High Command.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Red Army was put under almost the same conditions and worse throughout World War 2 (officers were told to kill any man who takes even one step back, marching into machine gun fire continued, etc.), and yet did not react as the French did years prior.\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is the difference? Why did the French Army revolt in less than a month while the Red Army remained loyal from start to finish? The answer is simple. The French were guided by Catholicism. Their faith in a higher morality and benevolent God led them to place the lives of their fellows above the orders of the French High Command. The Soviets revered the State as if it were their god. To them, these orders were divine, and they were to do anything the State asked of them, even die. And it was prevalent even in extreme duress. There's a story of a Soviet Marine who was fighting in Stalingrad. As he was about to throw a Molotov cocktail, a bullet shattered it in his hand and he was engulfed in flames. However, rather than attempting to, say, stop drop and roll, or even scream in pain, the Marine grabbed another Molotov and ran straight at a German tank. He climbed on top of it and smashed the Molotov down onto the engine, destroying it and breaking the German offensive. \n\n\n\nThis is how deep their devotion to the State was. Soviet statues are also dead giveaways. Many look almost like old Roman statues, if not for the fact they are holding guns in their chiseled grip.

They deify the State.\n\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text, by the way.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also quite important in that people seem like they&amp;#39;re hardwired to worship something, anything. Not sure what it is about the human mind that needs that spiritual fulfillment, but the void must be filled with something, be it a god or gods, yourself, or the State.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s what happened in the Soviet Union when they took religion away from people, they treated the State as the moral authority. Whatever they said was a fundamental truth, and any who denied it was to be given over to them and killed. Hitler was trying to edge the German populace onto that, or at least something akin to North Korea, as he had already integrated himself into official prayers for the Hitler Youth. Before long, they would have phased out God entirely and they&amp;#39;d be praying to Hitler. Part of that was further mimicry of the Roman Empire, as the Romans believed their emperors to be gods just as much as they believed in Zeus or Hades. Hitler would have taken that role, but minus the paganism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deifying the State also has the consequence of what you mentioned: no higher moral authority. Let&amp;#39;s compare and contrast two nearly identical moments in history. On one side, we have the French Army at the Nivelle Offensive in World War 1. On the other side, we have the Red Army throughout World War 2. The disparity in the length of these two actually helps to strengthen it, as you&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the Nivelle Offensive was an attempt by the French High Command to break through the thick German defensive line at the French-German border. Officers were given orders to shoot any men attempting to retreat, and the soldiers themselves were marched straight into machine gun fire in an attempt to use superior numbers to overwhelm them. The result of the single battle was widespread mutiny. Many men killed their officers and tried to overthrow the French High Command.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the Red Army was put under almost the same conditions and worse throughout World War 2 (officers were told to kill any man who takes even one step back, marching into machine gun fire continued, etc.), and yet did not react as the French did years prior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what is the difference? Why did the French Army revolt in less than a month while the Red Army remained loyal from start to finish? The answer is simple. The French were guided by Catholicism. Their faith in a higher morality and benevolent God led them to place the lives of their fellows above the orders of the French High Command. The Soviets revered the State as if it were their god. To them, these orders were divine, and they were to do anything the State asked of them, even die. And it was prevalent even in extreme duress. There&amp;#39;s a story of a Soviet Marine who was fighting in Stalingrad. As he was about to throw a Molotov cocktail, a bullet shattered it in his hand and he was engulfed in flames. However, rather than attempting to, say, stop drop and roll, or even scream in pain, the Marine grabbed another Molotov and ran straight at a German tank. He climbed on top of it and smashed the Molotov down onto the engine, destroying it and breaking the German offensive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is how deep their devotion to the State was. Soviet statues are also dead giveaways. Many look almost like old Roman statues, if not for the fact they are holding guns in their chiseled grip. Some may be indistinguishable from Roman statues, like The Motherland Calls, one of the largest statues in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what the liberals have done.
