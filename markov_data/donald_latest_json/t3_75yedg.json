I agree with most everything you said, but I feel this sub has started drifting from it&amp;#39;s original intent (as I understood it), which is fucking &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt;, and a &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; assessment of the Donald -- we weren&amp;#39;t getting it elsewhere, so we came here. More and more, though, it seems this place is being overtaken by the same sort of virtue signaling we purport to be against.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fucking think for yourselves, guys. Don&amp;#39;t repeat talking points -- that isn&amp;#39;t a discussion and is doing no one any good, and makes you seem as ignorant as the MSM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "The_Donald", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_doaoe72", "created": 1507891288.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1507862488.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_75yedg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_75yedg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_dob0gzw", "id": "dob0gzw", "parent_id": "t1_doaimrq", "depth": 3, "children": ["dob0gzw"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "doaimrq", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zenoidan", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_doaazb8", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "So does the guy following you in traffic daily.
