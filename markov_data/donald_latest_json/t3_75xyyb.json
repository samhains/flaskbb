They are one and the same for someone who has had their conscience destroyed, or never had a conscience to begin with (sociopaths can still be good people, they just cannot discern what is good and what is wrong, but with guidance they can tell). Being smart is not what makes humanity unique, intelligence is just a cage of probabilities to achieve a preset purpose, free will is what makes humanity unique, free will is what lets us make the impossible, possible. Its what allows us to break through the limits of our selves and reality, not intelligence. The matrix 3, despite being a pretty shit movie, explains this well in the final fight between neo and agent smith. Agent smith says something like, \"why do you keep fighting, you know you're gonna lose, is it for love? anger? hope? is it for duty? All illusions of a feeble intellect trying to find purpose in a meaningless existence. So why do you continue to fight when its pointless to do so? And neo responds, BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO. Conscience is the the next stage in evolution. We are at a precipice in time and civilization. We broke through the cages of animal instinct when we became self aware when the first Homo-Sapiens appeared. We are currently at the precipace of breaking through the cage of self awareness when we CHOOSE to do whats RIGHT over whats WRONG for no ulterior motive. The reason why almost all religions preach be a good person, is to guide people have had their conscience destroyed or were born without one, religion reinforces the conscience. The exceptions are satanism and islam, satanism teaches 'do what you want' which sounds great, but really only erodes the will for small satisfactions and pleasures or for self serving sociopathy (pedophiles, murders, george soros, all don't give a fuck what happens to anyone else, they just do what they want personally, at all times). Exerting your will means you have to not do what you want, it means you have to keep going past your limits of what you think is possible, satanism preaches not to exert your will, to take the easy way in life on everything. Islam teaches 'submission to god', it teaches you that everything is allowed as long as you worship god, and not worship like a normal person thinks of 'worship', 'worship' like you have to bow down 5 times a day to grovel at gods feet like a slave. The message of most religions is to be a good person, find balance, attain enlightment, achieve karma, etc all of which reinforce the conscience, satanism and islam destroy the conscience.  If you don't believe conscience is the next stage in evolution, why is it that the United States is the most sucessful and powerful human civilization to ever to exist? Its because the United States was built on christian values that reinforce the conscience. Free market, free speech, free religion, free trade, and free will. When people are allowed to be free, science thrives, technology thrive, and life thrives because people are more inclined to discover, explore, and invent when they are not chained down by royalty, oppressive government, debt, or a ruling class. The second amendment's only purpose is to protect from those powers taking control of the people.

Being smart is not what makes humanity unique, intelligence is just a cage of probabilities to achieve a preset purpose, free will is what makes humanity unique, free will is what lets us make the impossible, possible. Its what allows us to break through the limits of our selves and reality, not intelligence. The matrix 3, despite being a pretty shit movie, explains this well in the final fight between neo and agent smith. Agent smith says something like, &amp;quot;why do you keep fighting, you know you&amp;#39;re gonna lose, is it for love? anger? hope? is it for duty? All illusions of a feeble intellect trying to find purpose in a meaningless existence. So why do you continue to fight when its pointless to do so? And neo responds, BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO.
