He was caught in the same ring as Paul Reubens. Both were stars in Tim Burton's films back to back.\n\nDavid Geffen was the producer who later would be an investor in DEN, the company at the center of \"An Open Secret.\" Geffen admits attending the notorious DEN parties with naked underage boys, he just says nothing untoward happened but everyone else says differently including Bret Easton Ellis.\n\nThe rest you can decide you on for yourself: Danny Elfman, who did the soundtrack for Beetlejuice and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (his only two films at that point), previously wrote \"I Love Little Girls\" in his band Oingo Boingo (that's the song \"pedo bear\" dances to BTW); Beetlejuice was only Winona Ryder's second film and she was discovered on Lucas - the same film Corey Haim was raped during filming; Beetlejuice was a pedophile in original scripts and attempting to rape Lydia Deetz - they changed it to marriage in the final script.\n\nHere's the article on underage sex at Studio 54: \n\n&gt;From the book, The Last Party: Studio 54, Disco, and the Culture of the Night, by Anthony Haden-Guest, in the chapter, Between the Acts: I - Goblin Market: [2]\n\n&gt;Under the circumstances, it is surprising that Studio [54] didn't generate a darker folklore than it did. There were a few horrors. A young woman went to Studio at fifteen and got into a conversation with a grandfatherly man, who kindly drove her to his apartment on Fifty-seventh Street to show her photographs of himself with Jimmy Carter. It seems that he then  may have slipped her a Mickey Finn. At any rate, she let herself be photographed in various naked poses.  Then he raped her. \"That must have been his MO,\" I was told. But exploitation of innocence is as old as time. Studio 54 merely offered an old perve the opportunity. Anyway, such squalid stories prove to be - surprisingly perhaps -few. Almost all the Studio kids look back on such tales as anomalies, the kind of stuff that might happen anyplace.\n\n&gt;Wrongly, in the eyes of some parents. \"It was a hellhole!
