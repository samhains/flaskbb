But not because conservative men have abused them. Because they are forced to be silent, for various sociological and psychological reasons, about their abuse at the hands of the \u2018in-crowd\u2019 of liberals by which they are surrounded. And they lash out at any convenient target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s put this in a perspective that might make sense: A high school cheerleading team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ll call the town this takes place in \u2018Hollywood\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the new freshman girls reach high school they\u2019re SOOO EXCITED! They were cheerleaders in junior high and now they might get on the JV CHEERLEADING TEAM and even be VARSITY CHEERLEADERS! YAY! GO HOLLYWOOD!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let\u2019s follow the career of a freshman aspiring JV cheerleader named, oh, Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As part of Ashley\u2019s tryout she\u2019s invited to a HIGH SCHOOL PARTY! (YAY! WE\u2019RE REALLY GROWN UP NOW!) And at that high school party she gets a little drunk and ends up in the morning in a bed full of strangers (various male varsity jocks) wearing nothing but her socks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s embarrassed and shocked and hurt and doesn\u2019t know what to do. Because she\u2019s never had an experience like that before. (Though she\u2019s rarely a virgin.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does she call them out? Does she report it? Will it affect her chances of being on the cheerleading team?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point she might open up to a Varsity Cheerleader we\u2019ll call, oh, Dame Judy D. And Dame Judy\u2019s rather cold response tends to be: Welcome to the bigs, sister. Now shut up and act.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so Ashley is now part of the herd. She\u2019s one of the \u2018important\u2019 people in high school. And she probably ends up being one of the mean girls who makes life horrible for the nerds. (Herein played by anyone with (R) after their name or anyone who can be defined as \u2018conservative\u2019.) And the reason that she makes life horrible for the nerds is THEY ARE THE ONLY SAFE TARGET!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she lashes out at the jocks and Varsity cheerleaders who are actually making her life hell, the best she can hope is a punch in the face. Worse SHE MIGHT BE THROWN OUT OF THE IN-CROWD! She might NEVER DO LUNCH IN THIS TOWN AGAIN!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when it\u2019s her time to be the Varsity Cheerleader and some newbie freshman wimp is crying and sulking she tells her: Welcome to the bigs, sis. Now shut up and act.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when that cheerleader finds a convenient nerd target (herein played by\u2026 oh, choose the R target of choice) she makes his life hell. Because she can. And she has to get the rage out somehow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s all part of abuse syndrome. I\u2019d wondered about it for some time but the \u2018revelations\u2019 about Harvey Weinstein just make it crystal clear. People who are subject to long-term abuse MUST find an outlet for the anger that bubbles in them all the time. They don\u2019t, dare not for various reasons, lash out at their abusers. Think of children in abusive homes. How can they lash out at their parents who are abusing them? They are powerless. So they become bullies in turn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conservatives are an easy target. OBVIOUSLY they are worse than the \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018decent\u2019 liberal men who talk about how important feminism is all the time. Then abuse them. Conservatives HAVE to be worse! They HAVE to be! It\u2019s just not getting reported, just as the abuse they are subjected to by the Harvey Weinsteins of the world is not reported. And since the people around them are \u2018their\u2019 tribe, they must, for various psychological reasons, be \u2018good\u2019 or at least \u2018better\u2019 than the enemy tribe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t conservatives just as shitty as Harvey Weinstein. There probably are. But they are MUCH more likely to be outed by the news media. (Think of Newt Gingrich and divorcing his dying wife or for that matter the Access Hollywood tape. Interesting that name keeps coming up don\u2019t you think?) Do you really think if a Republican senator was charged by a woman with groping her or masturbating into a plant, that the New York Times would kill the story?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that way the liberal bias in media can be considered a God send to conservatives and Republicans. It polices our ranks. It is a major weakness for the Democrats and liberals because it refuses to do so. Thus you get the Harvey Weinsteins, the Weiners, the Spitzers who are all \u2018protected\u2019 classes until they can\u2019t be protected anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do liberal actresses and models and all the rest really think conservative men are the worst human beings in the world?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes, they do. Because they have to work every day with some of the ACTUALLY worst human beings in the world. And they have to believe conservative men are worse. Otherwise, there\u2019s no point to being on the \u2018good\u2019 side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus when Donald Trump said some needlessly crass things and alleged to have groped women, they immediately saw in him not just Harvey (all the rest of the abusers in Hollywood High not to mention Billy \u2018I did not rape that woman\u2019 Clinton) but WORSE THAN HARVEY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because Trump has to be worse. They can\u2019t really be slaves to some of the most vile human beings on the face of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got news for you ladies: Yes, yes, you are. You enable them every day and by doing so you not only support the abusers, you directly or indirectly tell all the hurt new cheerleaders: Welcome to the bigs, sis.
