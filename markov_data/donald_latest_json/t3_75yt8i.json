Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifesta- tions of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discus- sion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduc- tion to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.\n7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, \u201cpolitically correct\u201d types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these move- ments is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discus- sing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by \u201cleftism\u201d will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. (Also, see paragraphs 227-230.)\n8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psycho- logical tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be tel- ling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discus- sion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie mo- dern leftism we call \u201cfeelings of inferiority\u201d and \u201cover- socialization\u201d. Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is cha- racteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.\nFEELINGS OF INFERIORITY\n10. By \u201cfeelings of inferiority\u201d we mean not only infe- riority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerless- ness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self-hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of mo- dern leftism.\n11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost any- thing that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hy- persensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. The terms \u201cnegro\u201d, \u201coriental\u201d, \u201chandicapped\u201d or \u201cchick\u201d for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman origi- nally had no derogatory connotation. \u201cBroad\u201d and \u201cchick\u201d were merely the feminine equivalents of \u201cguy\u201d, \u201cdude\u201d or \u201cfellow\u201d. The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word \u201cpet\u201d and insist on its replacement by \u201canimal compa- nion\u201d. Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could concei- vably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the word \u201cprimitive\u201d by \u201cnonliterate\u201d. They seem almost para- noid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hyper sensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)\n12. Those who are most sensitive about \u201cpolitically in- correct\u201d terminology are not the average black ghetto- dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled per- son, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any \u201coppressed\u201d group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families.\n13. Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homo- sexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is preci- sely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only ma- king a point about leftist psychology.)\n14. Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that wo- men are as strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.\n15. Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is war- like, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or\nin primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whe- reas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist\u2019s real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful.\n16. Words like \u201cself-confidence\u201d, \u201cself-reliance\u201d, \u201cini- tiative\u201d, \u201centerprise\u201d, \u201coptimism\u201d, etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti- individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve every one\u2019s problems for them, satisfy everyone\u2019s needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is antagohistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser.\n17. Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellec- tuals tend to focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an orgiastic tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing any- thing through rational calculation and all that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment.\n18. Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative. It is true that one can ask serious ques- tions about the foundations of scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish philoso- phers are not simply cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. They attack these concepts because of their own psycho- logical needs. For one thing, their attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it is successful, it satis- fies the drive for power. More importantly, the leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false (i.e., failed, inferior). The leftist\u2019s feelings of inferiority run so deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some things as successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. This also underlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental illness and of the utility of IQ tests. Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such explanations tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an individual\u2019s ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is \u201cinferior\u201d it is not his fault, but society\u2019s, because he has not been brought up properly.\n19. The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of inferiority make him a braggart, an egotist, a bully, a self-promoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly lost faith in himself. He has a de- ficit in his sense of power and self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity to be strong, and his efforts to make himself strong produce his un- pleasant behavior. [1] But the leftist is too far gone for that. His feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and va- luable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist. He can feel strong only as a member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.\n20. Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally provoke police or racists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be effective, but many leftists use them not as a means to an end but because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist trait.\n21. Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principles, and moral principle does play a role for the leftist of the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calcula- ted to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. For example, if one believes that af- firmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. In doing so they actually harm black people, because the activists\u2019 hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred.\n22. If our society had no social problems at all, the lef- tists would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss.\n23. We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It is only a rough indication of a ge- neral tendency of leftism.\nOVERSOCIALIZATION\n24. Psychologists use the term \u201csocialization\u201d to desi- gnate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are over-socialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Ne- vertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.\n25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order\nto avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral ex- planations for feelings and actions that in reality have a nonmoral origin. We use the term \u201coversocialized\u201d to des- cribe such people. [2]\n26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society\u2019s expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocia- lized person are more restricted by society\u2019s expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. The majo- rity of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person can- not do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The over- socialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted mo- rality; he cannot think \u201cunclean\u201d thoughts. And socializa- tion is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. In many over- socialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human being inflict on one another.\n27. We argue that a very important and influential seg- ment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the overso- cialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals [3] constitute the most highly socialized segment of our so- ciety and also the most leftwing segment.\n28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebel- ling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally speaking, the goals of today\u2019s leftists are NOT in conflict with the accep- ted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle. Examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. All these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes [4] for a long time. These va- lues are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system. Lef tists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hos- tility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles.\n29. Here is an illustration of the way in which the over- socialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conven- tional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion aginst it. Many leftists push for affirmative ac- tion, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the black \u201cunderclass\u201d they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business execu- tive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class white people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man; ins- tead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in what does this preservation of African American culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than ea- ting black-style food, listening to black-style music, wea- ring black-style clothing and going to a black-style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in su- perficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers \u201cresponsible,\u201d they want black gangs to be- come nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the industrial- technological system. The system couldn\u2019t care less what kind of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a \u201cresponsible\u201d parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the over- socialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values.\n30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamen- tal values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society\u2019s most important principles by en- gaging in physical violence. By their own account, vio- lence is for them a form of \u201cliberation.\u201d In other words, by committing violence they break through the psycholo- gical restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence their need to break free of them. But they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like.\n31. We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex, and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have in- dicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.\n32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the pro-\nblems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depres- sive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left, they are widespread in our society. And today\u2019s society tries to so- cialize us to a greater extent than any previous society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM\n6.

We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It is only a rough indication of a ge- neral tendency of leftism.\nOVERSOCIALIZATION\n24. Psychologists use the term \u201csocialization\u201d to desi- gnate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are over-socialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Ne- vertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.\n25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order\nto avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral ex- planations for feelings and actions that in reality have a nonmoral origin. We use the term \u201coversocialized\u201d to des- cribe such people. [2]\n26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society\u2019s expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocia- lized person are more restricted by society\u2019s expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. The majo- rity of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person can- not do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The over- socialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted mo- rality; he cannot think \u201cunclean\u201d thoughts. And socializa- tion is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. In many over- socialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human being inflict on one another.\n27. We argue that a very important and influential seg- ment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the overso- cialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals [3] constitute the most highly socialized segment of our so- ciety and also the most leftwing segment.\n28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebel- ling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally speaking, the goals of today\u2019s leftists are NOT in conflict with the accep- ted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle. Examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. All these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes [4] for a long time. These va- lues are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system. Lef tists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hos- tility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles.\n29. Here is an illustration of the way in which the over- socialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conven- tional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion aginst it. Many leftists push for affirmative ac- tion, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the black \u201cunderclass\u201d they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business execu- tive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class white people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man; ins- tead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in what does this preservation of African American culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than ea- ting black-style food, listening to black-style music, wea- ring black-style clothing and going to a black-style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in su- perficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers \u201cresponsible,\u201d they want black gangs to be- come nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the industrial- technological system. The system couldn\u2019t care less what kind of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a \u201cresponsible\u201d parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the over- socialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values.\n30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamen- tal values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society\u2019s most important principles by en- gaging in physical violence. By their own account, vio- lence is for them a form of \u201cliberation.\u201d In other words, by committing violence they break through the psycholo- gical restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence their need to break free of them. But they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like.\n31. We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex, and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have in- dicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.\n32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the pro-\nblems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depres- sive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left, they are widespread in our society. And today\u2019s society tries to so- cialize us to a greater extent than any previous society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "75yt8i", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Ted Kacynski's \"Industrial Society and It's Future\" sums up leftism pretty well.
