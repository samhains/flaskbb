Thats not america that needs to answer for these injustices, just the democrats. \n\nMaragret Sanger,  founded Planned parenthood. Racist AF. Talked about ridding society of the undisreables. The feeble minded and lower classes. Spoke at KKK rallies. Over 75% of abortion clinics are in minority communities. How all the injustices blacks have faced in this country (including slavery) they dont come close to planned parenthood. 16,000,000 black american human fetuses aborted. Why dont you tear down those monuments? Instead youre after Columbus. Atleast the spread of smallpox wasnt intentional. Natives gave us syphilis and tobacco. How many people have died from tobacco? Isnt it strange we never referred to the bubonic plague as asians genocide of europe? Their disease wiped out 1/3 of europe. I guess only the white man and west is to be blamed for the world turning. Interesting. Nevermind there is still slaves throughout the middle east, TODAY. And never mind that inconvenient hate fact that slavery was common practice and africans and muslims sold and used wayyy more slaves than the west ever did. A lot more brutal to boot. As bad as slavery was here, america only had 5% of the slaves and the slave life here was much better. At least they had value. They had to be shipped here after being kidnapped as war loot from conquering african tribes. Native americans had slaves too, numbnuts. Em, you are so brave and really went out on a limb being POLITICALLY CORRECT. What a rebel. \n\nWhat about gun control. You mentioned LV. Democrats created gun control to disarm free men/blacks. They went on to lynch almost 6,000 people (1,500 white republicans). All you do is rap about murder, torture and raping your own mother. Youre the epitome of a useful idiot. CNN's perfect viewer. You dont know what youre talking about. You entertain people. Youre a toy. \n\nYou are worried about nuclear war? Fearmonger much? You spineless coward talking about your love for country as rocketman is shooting nukes over our allies heads and into our oceans.\n\n You spoke of Trump's orange hair. Not your most creative moment. \"The simpsons did it\" comes to mind. You spoke of taxes like this is something you have to even worry about like normal people do. You carry water for mainstream EVERYTHING with your rant. Johnson &amp; Johnson stock doubled overnight from peroxide sales, alone, after slim shady. Marshall Matters, you are the epitome of corporate livestock.  Thx to you, slim shady finally knocked the powdered wig off its throne as the worst hair cut in american history.  \n\nWhat have you done to help Detroit? Besides give it a bad name and image, Mr. 8mile. It was the democrats who redlined around the now shithole you once called home. How have you used your immense wealth? By normalizing thuggery? Bill Clinton's 3 strikes law locked up a generation of fathers. This hurt the black community more than others. Children need discipline. They crave it and naturally seek it out. They also naturally yearn for protection. Without a father in their home they find it on a corner or in a gang and turn to thug culture for discipline, which you glorify. In fact, case in point. I will however give you credit for sticking around for your daughter. A crazy dysfunctional life, well documented by you, but you obviously love her.

Blistering ignorant on all these issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pfft, love our military and country but gives shout out to Krapernick the commie. Hey assholes. Thats not america that needs to answer for these injustices, just the democrats. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maragret Sanger,  founded Planned parenthood. Racist AF. Talked about ridding society of the undisreables. The feeble minded and lower classes. Spoke at KKK rallies. Over 75% of abortion clinics are in minority communities. How all the injustices blacks have faced in this country (including slavery) they dont come close to planned parenthood. 16,000,000 black american human fetuses aborted. Why dont you tear down those monuments? Instead youre after Columbus. Atleast the spread of smallpox wasnt intentional. Natives gave us syphilis and tobacco. How many people have died from tobacco? Isnt it strange we never referred to the bubonic plague as asians genocide of europe? Their disease wiped out 1/3 of europe. I guess only the white man and west is to be blamed for the world turning. Interesting. Nevermind there is still slaves throughout the middle east, TODAY. And never mind that inconvenient hate fact that slavery was common practice and africans and muslims sold and used wayyy more slaves than the west ever did. A lot more brutal to boot. As bad as slavery was here, america only had 5% of the slaves and the slave life here was much better. At least they had value. They had to be shipped here after being kidnapped as war loot from conquering african tribes. Native americans had slaves too, numbnuts. Em, you are so brave and really went out on a limb being POLITICALLY CORRECT. What a rebel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about gun control. You mentioned LV. Democrats created gun control to disarm free men/blacks. They went on to lynch almost 6,000 people (1,500 white republicans). All you do is rap about murder, torture and raping your own mother. Youre the epitome of a useful idiot. CNN&amp;#39;s perfect viewer. You dont know what youre talking about. You entertain people. Youre a toy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are worried about nuclear war? Fearmonger much? You spineless coward talking about your love for country as rocketman is shooting nukes over our allies heads and into our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You spoke of Trump&amp;#39;s orange hair. Not your most creative moment. &amp;quot;The simpsons did it&amp;quot; comes to mind. You spoke of taxes like this is something you have to even worry about like normal people do. You carry water for mainstream EVERYTHING with your rant. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson stock doubled overnight from peroxide sales, alone, after slim shady. Marshall Matters, you are the epitome of corporate livestock.  Thx to you, slim shady finally knocked the powdered wig off its throne as the worst hair cut in american history.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What have you done to help Detroit? Besides give it a bad name and image, Mr. 8mile. It was the democrats who redlined around the now shithole you once called home. How have you used your immense wealth? By normalizing thuggery? Bill Clinton&amp;#39;s 3 strikes law locked up a generation of fathers. This hurt the black community more than others. Children need discipline. They crave it and naturally seek it out. They also naturally yearn for protection. Without a father in their home they find it on a corner or in a gang and turn to thug culture for discipline, which you glorify. In fact, case in point.
