Assuming you'd be able to organise an insurrection before the existing hierarchy managed to assassinate you then there's still the little issue of brother against brother when it comes down to it. You'd be up to your armpits in blood five minutes into any conflict for that reason.\n\n&gt; the Swiss Guard\n\nThe Swiss Guard are the visible face of the Vatican's military. Don't think for a second that they don't have other personnel and resources. Not to mention what billions of dollars can hire on the open market. And all that before you factor in die hard fanatics that are willing to die sans payment.\n\n&gt; Really, and uprising is all there is besides waiting however long it will take for Bergoglio to die.\n\nHere's the bad news: this is as good as it gets. What possible reason does the Church have to be better than they are?\n\n&gt; The Vatican's politics are archaic, and while we were founded by Jesus, it was mainly Peter and the other disciples (well, those who hadn't already been crucified by the Romans) who determined the layout of the Church, how it's politics would work. And as good men as they were, I don't think they forsaw the possibility that the Church could be corrupted later.\n\nAt the time the Romans would have been the most civilised people on earth, the Jews would have been a bunch of goatfuckers (much like parts of the Middle East today). When the high point of civilised behaviour is the Romans bringing order one crucifixion at a time then it would have been a truly sorry mess indeed. These were not good men, they were influential men by virtue of being part of a Jewish offshoot cult. The only thing of note about their cult is that it survived and became the Christian religions. In practice they'd have been fucking underage groupies and harping on about the end of the world like all cultists do. Men with power are all the same. Today isn't worse, today is the same as it's always been.\n\nI can guarantee there would have been people exactly like you back then hoping for someone to usurp the throne too. Things are *always* better when that *pesky bastard* causing all the problems is 6 foot under - and that's an attitude that not only predates the Church, it predates humanity. Any animal that lives in a social hierarchy has politics of deposition. The Romans certainly understood the effectiveness of dealing with Jesus's challenge to their authority - they nailed him to a cross (he got the last laugh, even if it took a while).\n\n&gt; They likely assumed that anyone taking positions in the Church would be pious men only. \n\nThere is nothing more pernicious than someone that believes they are the will of God incarnate. At least the wilfully corrupt have self awareness.\n\nA pious man doesn't dress in golden robes and live in a palace decorated in antiquities. A pious man would sell everything the Church had and use the money to help the poor and the sick^(1). Actions always speak louder than words, don't you think?\n\n&gt; Quite simply, something must change in the Vatican's political structure so that this doesn't happen again. Maybe some kind of test of faith, or even giving the Laity the ability to vote upon Cardinals, or at least vote upon some sort of council that can investigate heresy and corruption, and expel those heretical members from their positions of power. \n\n1. You are stuck with what you have. The vast majority of believers are happy with it (by which I mean they'll complain ad infinitum but aren't prepared to spill blood over it).\n\n1. The test of faith here is simple: if you seriously want to get involved in politics and rule over others then you failed.\n\n1. The laity aren't going to get a vote. The Church is a theocratic institution, not a democratic one. Unsurprisingly when one has a foundational belief in the perfection and supremacy of God, the word of God, and in his high priests then logically democracy is *heresy*.\n\n1. If the high priests administer the theology then they decide what is and isn't heresy and thus will never be bureaucratically removed.\n\n&gt; That's what the Church needs to survive.\n\nThe Church is doing just fine. Business is good. They're not going anywhere, certainly not in our lifetimes.\n\n&gt; It needs this reform, so that it will never be corrupted again.\n\nNever is a long time, too long I'd wager. Also, when men rule over men there will always be corruption.\n\n&gt; If violence, and dare I say it, a war is what it takes, then it is our duty to stand up and fight for the preservation of our faith.\n\nFor the love of god can you just split into your own sect instead of causing unnecessary bloodshed? If you really must kill anyone, why don't you do us all a favour and kill Muslims? They're clearly more of a pressing threat than internal Church intrigues.\n\nHere's my two cents as a person of no faith whatsoever: worry about your own salvation first, those you care about next, and then if you have an overwhelming urge to waste your life worry about the wellbeing of the Church. As long as the Church is run by men it's going to be a shitshow. It's an organisation of billions of people, from different cultures, places, backgrounds, and it has untold billions in assets, and influence in the highest places. How could it be anything other than a never ending procession of human failings? Frankly, considering what was just enumerated it's a miracle that the Church isn't twice as bad as it is.\n\nThere's a single reason you're disappointed with the Church: you're expecting the Church to be something it can never be. How it could possibly be run by men and be what you want it to be for even a week, let alone until the end of time? It isn't going to happen.\n\n----\n1) If the Vatican liquidated a mere fraction of its art collection it could probably fund enough medical research to cure cancer.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "kekistan", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose there&amp;#39;s a need to reiterate, there&amp;#39;s no need to kill anyone if they stand down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are talking about a religious civil war.
