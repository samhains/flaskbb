I'm going to give you a break down a little bit because this has really been fucking with me. It could be something, it could be nothing. \n\n\nI'm getting to know a new friend who I brought to my house with a long time buddy. From the start of hanging out we're talking about music festivals, he says how Electric Forest is his second home, dude was really attached to the fest and had gone many years. The last one he stood out there the entire two weeks because they had two weekends, that's dedication for me right there. I figured this was a source of great knowledge because I was soon going to my first weekend camp fest. So I'm telling him how excited I am for my festival coming up, Lost Lands hosted by a dj named Excision. This guy loves Electric Forest (EF), we love the same music, so I'm surprised when he says \"fuck excision\". \n\n\nI ask him why, he says \"he took the K away\". \n\n\nI ponder further - Excision is wildly popular, basically defined the dubstep scene after Skrillex. He made a song called Robo Kitty. Officially released at the start of 2015, meaning the song was probably teased at live shows starting 2013 or earlier (that's how DJs do). Kitty is a common nickname for Ketamine. Right around this same time, Ketamine starts getting a sharp eye in the U.K. And US, threatened to be banned or rescheduled higher, and the rave scene readily blames this song for the uproar because Excision has such a far reach. \n\n\nSo there was heat on this DJ for this, deserved or not. So I start to ask this guy, why Ketamine? I had been to many concerts in my home city, been thru 5 yrs of college, and luckily this kitty litter shit had not really crossed my path. Furthermore, as I was going to be attending Excision's festival, I'm genuinely concerned for my safety if so much of this scene supposedly hates the guy hosting. How did this stuff get so prevalent in the first place? \n\n\nThe friend then gives me this whole rundown about why fest-goers like the drug, how around Saturday-Sunday many regulars will \"need\" it to get back to the same level their X or LSD had them at Friday. Makes sense, it rounds out the weekend. So I ask him more and more about these festivals, how have things been since there's been less K, I want to be prepared. He's being a little more dismissive as I go on, the more we talked about it the more I could see this guy was getting agitated, he couldn't have anymore K either. A lot of his fests from 2015 on seemed to be not as great as before when the \"litter flowed\". Oh well.\n\n\nSo I felt bad, and tried to shift the convo a little bit - so we're talking more and more about EF, and I ask him about the craziest wildest shit he has seen there. This is where the Obama story comes in. He said he wasn't really even supposed to be telling me about this, but he swore on his life that Obama called into the festival. He said how it was the only time in his fest history they broadcasted someone over all their stages simultaneously. Apparently Obama is saying how bad things will start to happen if Trump wins. At the end, he also supposedly made an \"old man comment\" - something along the lines of \"idk what you kids call it these days...kitty litter?\" And from then I guess it was Game On that year, because a lot of people gave in and tried K that year because he mentioned the drug, thinking it was relatively safer than imagined. \n\n\nI'll admit I don't know many more Forest-goers, and politics is such a lame topic around those types, I really don't get any venues to discuss this. Not to mention since a large portion of this scene considers themselves \"recovering Ketamine addicts\" now, why start that discussion and put them on edge. It scares me to think about, because it would lend a lot of credibility to why Antifa has become so crazily radical, ketamine became a Class B drug in the U.K. by the end of 2015. How far away Rothbury is also lends some credibility to how easy it'd be to mess with the cell towers there. No one can get this drug anymore in the old form they made it, *except those in power*. A lot of these protest groups Veritas is uncovering seem to be very well connected. I find it highly suspicious how all the videos on Vice and most Google searches for ketamine are pushing it as a new wonder-treatment for depression, like they're trying to reverse the new heightened restrictions or make it not appear as bad as it is. Having seen folks on it, I equate that to pushing chemotherapy to help shed some hair, that shit is bad news.\n\n\nSorry if long-winded, when I don't have any evidence other than my story I try to paint the picture as clearly as I can.
