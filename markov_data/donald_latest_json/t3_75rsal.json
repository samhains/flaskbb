What prompted that change?\n\nThe organization has been around for 30 years. Before I came on fourteen years ago, it had a reputation of being a fiscal sponsor. It didn\u2019t have any staff. It didn\u2019t have any budget. We were the backroom for lots of organizations that didn\u2019t have their own 501(c)(3).\n \n&gt;What do you mean when you say backroom?\n\nWe provided financial support, management support and legal support. A lot of groups didn\u2019t want to get their own 501(c)(3). So they couldn\u2019t get foundation dollars. We were able to do it for them. We did their HR as needed, their accounting, all of that. We were known as Public Interest Projects then. I had been working for a very wealthy family in their family office, and I\u2019d become very interested in the whole collaborative idea, of foundations coming together and capitalizing a fund, so that they could do their grantmaking together around a particular strategy. When I came on board, I was very interested in creating a model that would do it differently and better than where I was. We started with one collaborative fund, and now we\u2019ve done over twelve of them. We still work as a fiscal sponsor, and we also do donor advised funds.\n \n&gt;So that shift in focus is what inspired you to change the name?\n\nThe name Public Interest Projects was essentially picked out of a hat. The original founder, Donald Ross, wanted the organization to be under the radar so that people wouldn\u2019t necessarily know what it did. Before I came, we were always in the back, never in the front. Once we started developing our work, the name became confusing to people. It didn\u2019t say who we were, and it didn\u2019t say anything about our values.\n \n&gt;It didn\u2019t give you a concrete identity.\n\nRight. We had just gone along with it for years and years and years because we were so busy building the organization. We started with zero, and now we have a budget of $52 million. We have over 40 staff members, we\u2019ve done 12 collaborative funds, we have almost 40 fiscally sponsored projects and donor-advised projects. A couple of years ago, one of our board members said, \u201cYour name doesn\u2019t say anything about who you are.\u201d So we thought, okay, let\u2019s consider a rebranding process. The whole idea was to think through, \u201cWhat do we want people to think about us? What values do we care about? What things are important to us? Who is our audience?\u201d It was almost like doing a strategic plan, but doing it in a different way. It was about connecting the dots for people, to be able to show them that there are many different ways of being involved with us. You could have a donor advised fund, you could support one of our projects, or you could join one of our collaborative funds.\n \n&gt;How do you see those three things\u2014donor advised funds, donating to projects and collaborative funds\u2014working together? How do they create a robust brand narrative that you guys can stand behind?\n\nWe have folks who have a donor-advised fund with us, and they fund one of our collaborative funds. There are many ways to get money out the door. But we\u2019re not a transactional shop. There are lots of places that have donor advised funds where the donor calls up and says, \u201cWrite these checks to these organizations.\u201d We do it very differently. The donors we tend to work with often want to go deeper, and they want the program expertise that our staff has. Our staff is full of highly developed program-rich people, and it\u2019s a much richer model. We can be transactional, and we have been. The rebranding helped us get to the place where we are now. It helped us figure out how to talk to people about our strengths. We know where our niche is and our space.
