He's just a smart guy that knows how to fix things and has the wherewithal to shrug off anything the left can throw at him.  That's why WE elected him and that's why WE continue to support him.\n\nThis is the fundamental failing of the left and the GOP.  They think they're the ones in charge.  They think Trump is doing all this.  All Trump is doing is speaking his mind.  It's the *people* that agree with him and who are fucking fed up with business as usual that are doing the work.  The left does not and more importantly *cannot* understand this, for to understand that is to admit that maybe you're wrong about an issue, which is intellectually impossible for them.  Without their moral superiority they have literally nothing to offer.
