The U.S. population is 324,059,091 as of June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.0000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\n\u2022 65% of those deaths are by suicide, which would never be prevented by gun laws.\n\u2022 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified.\n\u2022 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons - better known as gun violence.\n\u2022 3% are accidental discharge deaths.\nSo technically, &amp;quot;gun violence&amp;quot; is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Now lets look at how those deaths spanned across the nation.\n\u2022 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago\n\u2022 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore\n\u2022 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit\n\u2022 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)\nSo basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\nThis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.\nNow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equal, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\nAre 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault are all done by criminals. It is ludicrous to think that criminals will obey laws. That is why they are called criminals.\nBut what about other deaths each year?\n\u2022 40,000+ die from a drug overdose-THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!\n\u2022 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths.\n\u2022 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide).\nNow it gets good:\n\u2022 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer walking in the worst areas of Chicago than you are when you are in a hospital!\n\u2022 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It&amp;#39;s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If the liberal loons and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total number of gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides ................ Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions! So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It&amp;#39;s pretty simple:\nTaking away guns gives control to governments. The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\nThus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs. So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: &amp;quot;Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed.&amp;quot; We now know what they&amp;#39;re trying to do&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed.
