A dozen houses with an average equity of $100K in each is a net worth of $1.2M.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I wrote a couple of postings ago, simply making regular investments in a 401(k) (or IRA) for 40 years will almost certainly compound to over $1M.  A financial writer called it the &amp;quot;Margarita Millionaire&amp;quot; plan: investing the equivalent of a top-shelf margarita per day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$10 per day, or $300 per month, invested in an S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund would easily get you there, even at a relatively conservative 9% return per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past 40 years, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has yielded an average annualized return of 11%.  At 11%, the same contribution rate would achieve $2M.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point I&amp;#39;m trying to make:  you are making assumptions from a position of ignorance, because you don&amp;#39;t know how long-term investing in either equities or real-estate can indeed turn you into a millionaire during your working career.
