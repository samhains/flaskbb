Republicans were given full control of the federal government. They \u2013 you \u2013 have done nothing. Worse, it is painfully clear that you intend to do nothing because, as is most apparent, you had no intention of honoring your solemn commitments to the American people. You were not going to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d You are the swamp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You and the rest of your leadership team were given the majority because you pledged to stop the steady flow of illegal immigration. You\u2019ve done nothing. You pledged to reduce the size of this oppressive federal government. You have done nothing. You pledged to reduce, and ultimately eliminate the out-of-control deficit spending that is bankrupting America. You have done nothing. You promised to repeal Obamacare, \u201croot and branch.\u201d You\u2019ve done nothing. You promised tax reform. You\u2019ve done nothing.\nYou don\u2019t even show up for work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While your attacks on those within the Republican Party who were attempting to keep the GOP\u2019s promises in the era of President Obama are now legendary, your current failure to deliver on the highest priority commitments to the American people is nothing short of shocking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest betrayal \u2013 and that is what it is \u2013 is your failure to repeal Obamacare, the single most devastating piece of legislation against freedom ever crafted. Every single Republican in federal office today is there because of the pledge to end this horror. We are now in October of 2017. The Republicans control the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. The GOP controls it all, thanks to that commitment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;President Trump and the House of Representatives have done their part. You sank it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;President Trump reasonably asked when he arrived in the White House \u201cWhere is the bill?\u201d After seven long years, you didn\u2019t have a bill ready to go. You\u2019d scheduled no committee hearings when you knew some in your caucus would not tolerate a bill without hearings. You had no plan at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;America has not forgotten that Obamacare does not apply to you. You and your leadership team saw to that, even when far more ethical members of Congress tried to change that slippery exemption. That is not \u201cleadership.\u201d That\u2019s cronyism, and precisely why the American people want the swamp drained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this time we could have been at work building the wall to protect Americans from the flow of illegal immigration, and also the flow of terrorists bent on wreaking destruction on our towns and cities. But you haven\u2019t allowed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this time in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration, even with an opposition party controlling the House, his tax cut package had been the law of the land for months, and America was on her way to an explosion of historic growth. But under your \u201cleadership,\u201d there\u2019s not even a commitment to real reform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You confirmed President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, but you\u2019ve also left our judiciary hanging in the balance. With well over 100 vacancies on the federal bench and 50 nominees awaiting action in the Senate you all have performed the Herculean task of confirming \u2026 seven?! That\u2019s less than one judge per month!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reasonable people can disagree on the larger issue of abortion, but science has proven that 20 week-old babies in the womb can feel the pain and torture of being aborted. The House, addressing the scientific community\u2019s concerns and consensus, has passed the Pain Capable Act three times. President Trump has publicly stated his eagerness to sign this legislation. Not only will you and your leadership team not lift a finger to advance this bill and help end these atrocities, your chief deputy, Senator John Cornyn, deemed \u201cPain Capable\u201d to be \u201cnot a short-term priority,\u201d all but declaring the bill dead-on-arrival.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Defunding the abortion mill Planned Parenthood is another promise you have failed to deliver on. Chief among your responsibilities is to be stewards of taxpayer resources, and yet, inexplicably, Planned Parenthood continues to receive $500 million in federal funds annually, with no end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more could be accomplished if you and the rest of your Gang of 5 leadership team would work harder, and require the rest of the Senate to do the same. The American people work 8-10-12 hours daily. How hard do their elected representatives work? On this, the 282nd day of 2017, you all have barely worked more than 100 days! And many of those \u201cdays\u201d count coming in for a vote or two at 5:30 p.m.\nMany Americans celebrated \u201cColumbus Day.\u201d What would they think if they knew \u2013 if you told them \u2013 you have arranged it so you and your colleagues celebrate \u201cColumbus Week\u201d?\nIn the real world this level of performance would get you fired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When one compares the number of bills passing through the House to the Senate\u2019s lack of performance, your leadership looks even less capable. As Speaker Ryan recently noted, the House is passing bills \u2013 including items central to your campaign promises \u2013 and not only do they languish in the Senate, but you and your leadership team publicly declare some of them dead on arrival.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to not repealing Obamacare, not reigning in spending and debt, not restraining then-President Obama\u2019s massive expansion of government, not reducing the power of the bureaucracy (especially the IRS), not only failing to secure our borders but fighting for amnesty and open borders, you and your leadership team have proven to be abject failures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your legalized bribery through deceitfully advancing the Export-Import Bank and other schemes that benefit donors but not ordinary Americans, and your extremely selective support for one part of one part of the U.S. Constitution (that being that part of the First Amendment related to free speech, but only insofar as it relates to campaign financing that you favor) has made it clear that you and your leadership team will be brave fighters for your Washington-based fat-cat donors and your own power, but not for the American people, any identifiable principles, nor even for the very things you all said during your campaigns that you believed in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those substantive failures come on top of your vicious, continuous, merciless attacks on grassroots Republicans, but most especially conservatives. Why do you hate the very people who are the biggest bloc of voters supporting every single member of the GOP Senate Caucus?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have told us in no uncertain terms, for many years, in many ways, that it is your purpose to \u201ccrush conservatives everywhere.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine what would happen to a football team in which the quarterback was continuously by word and deed making it clear that he loathed his offensive linemen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have used race-baiting tactics without reservation when it suited your purposes, but the minute Democrats used such tactics against you in your last Senate race you wailed and gnashed your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have used the un-American tactic of \u201cblacklisting\u201d vendors who dared to work for candidates who were not the leadership\u2019s chosen candidates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have abandoned good conservative GOP nominees for no other reason than that they were conservative. One need look no farther than the last election cycle when you abandoned the Republican grassroots\u2019 Colorado Senate candidate \u2013 Air Force Academy graduate, African-American veteran and twice-elected official Darryl Glenn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2016, there were only two states in which the GOP had a chance to pick up Senate seats \u2013 Colorado and Nevada. In Nevada you led $25 million worth of spending on behalf of your\nchosen candidate, but you refused to spend any money on behalf of Darryl Glenn in Colorado simply because he was conservative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both candidates lost by three percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There sat another vote for Obamacare repeal, but you were willing to sacrifice a Republican senate seat rather than have a conservative whom you would not control join the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t blame others for falling one vote short \u2013 the fault is yours and the rest of your Gang of 5 leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it\u2019s not just Darryl Glenn. We remember your support for Arlen Specter, for Charlie Christ over Marco Rubio, and for Planned Parenthood\u2019s favorite Independent candidate, (chairman) Lisa Murkowski over GOP nominee Joe Miller in Alaska in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You and your leadership team \u2013 Senators John Cornyn, Roy Blunt, John Thune and John Barrasso \u2013 have made war with your own grassroots while cynically refusing to honor one solemn pledge after another to the American people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is time for you and your leadership team to step aside for new leadership that is committed to the promises made to the American people.
