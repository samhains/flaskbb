He then invited me to his room. I quickly declined and asked his assistant if my car was outside. She said it wasn&amp;#39;t and wouldn&amp;#39;t be for a bit and I should go to his room. At that moment I felt very powerless and scared but didn&amp;#39;t want to act that way hoping that I was wrong about the situation. When I arrived I was relieved to find another woman in his room and thought immediately I was safe. He asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction. I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing. And I began to sing....i thought it would make the situation better....more professional....like an audition....i was so nervous. After singing I said again that I had to leave.He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips.

I had to defend myself. He\u2019s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. He tried more than once. This was never going to be about work. He had other intentions \u2013 I could see that very clearly. All throughout the evening, he flirted and stared at me as if I was a piece of meat. It was hard to say no because he\u2019s so powerful. I\u2019m an actress and he\u2019s a producer. We are in the same industry, so its impossible to avoid him. I\u2019ve seen how he operates: the way he looks for an opening. The way he tests women to see what he can get away with. That\u2019s the most disgusting thing. Everyone knew what Harvey was up to and no one did anything. It\u2019s unbelievable that he\u2019s been able to act like this for decades and still keep his career.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asia Argento&lt;/strong&gt;: The Italian actress has accused Weinstein of forcibly performing oral sex on her when she was 21. &amp;#39;He terrified me, and he was big.

He re-emerged naked a couple of minutes later and asked if I would give him a massage. Panicking, in shock, I remember weighing up the options and wondering how much I needed to placate him to keep myself safe. I told him I was uncomfortable and that I was angry that I had been tricked into this position. He pleaded with me to let him massage me and I let him put his hands on my shoulders while my mind raced. Harvey chased me, d&lt;strong&gt;k, b&lt;/strong&gt;ls and all, and banged on the door with his fists, pleading with me to come out.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louisette Geiss&lt;/strong&gt;:  Actress was called to a late night meeting with Weinstein in 2008.

When she arrived Weinstein presented her with three scripts for his next three movies which he would let her star in, only if she had three-way sex with him.

Speaking to the New Yorker, she said that she suffered years of trauma after the incident which occurred in a &amp;#39;casting meeting&amp;#39; in a Miramax office in Manhattan. He reportedly called her late at night after the incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mira Sorvino&lt;/strong&gt;: The Mighty Aphrodite actress told the New Yorker that Weinstein tried to massage her in a hotel room at the 1995 Toronto International Film Festival.

At a hotel meeting he tried to put her hand on his erect penis, she claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rose McGowan&lt;/strong&gt;: The actress, who made her breakthrough in 1996 in the Weinstein-produced slasher revival movie Scream, reportedly sued Weinstein after he assaulted her in 1997 at the Sundance Film Festival.

On Sunday she referred to being abused by a &amp;#39;monster&amp;#39; and has previously referred to being raped by a studio head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley Judd&lt;/strong&gt;: Judd&amp;#39;s film roles include the 1997 thriller Kiss the Girls - and says that during the filming of that movie Weinstein repeatedly asked her to watch him shower. She was one of the women who spoke out to The New York Times this week, saying: &amp;#39;Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it&amp;#39;s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emma De Caunes&lt;/strong&gt;: French actress Emma de Caunes said that she met Weinstein in 2010, soon after he told her he had a script he was producing based on a book with a strong female character. Weinstein offered to show her the script, and asked her up to his hotel room, where he began to take a shower. He then emerged naked and with an erection, asking her to lay down with him on the bed and telling her that many had done so before. &amp;#39;I was very petrified,&amp;#39; said de Caunes. &amp;#39;But I didn\u2019t want to show him that I was petrified, because I could feel that the more I was freaking out, the more he was excited.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren O&amp;#39;Connor&lt;/strong&gt;: A former employee of The Weinstein Company, she told executives there in the fall of 2015 that there was &amp;#39;a toxic environment for women at this company&amp;#39; after one of her colleagues told her that Weinstein had pressured her into massaging him while he was naked, the NYT said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambra Battilana&lt;/strong&gt;: An Italian actress and model, she told the NYT that in March 2015 Weinstein invited her to his New York office. There, she said, he asked if her breasts were real before grabbing them and putting his hands up her skirt. She reported the alleged incident to police, but they did not press charges. According to the NYT, Weinstein later paid her off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica Barth&lt;/strong&gt;: Weinstein reportedly pressured Barth, an actress, to give him a naked massage in the Peninsula Hotel from 2011 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Madden&lt;/strong&gt;: An ex-employee, she told the NYT that Weinstein had asked her to give him massages from 1991 onwards, while they were both in London and Dublin. &amp;#39;It was so manipulative,&amp;#39; she told the NYT. &amp;#39;You constantly question yourself - am I the one who is the problem?&amp;#39; Weinstein denied knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emily Nestor&lt;/strong&gt;: Nestor was a temporary employee of the Weinstein Company for just one day in 2014 when Weinstein approached her and offered to boost her career in exchange for sex, the NYT reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelda Perkins&lt;/strong&gt;: An assistant of Weinstein&amp;#39;s based in London in 1998; then 25, she reportedly confronted Weinstein after she and &amp;#39;several&amp;#39; others were harassed and later settled out of court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Karlsen&lt;/strong&gt;: The Oscar-nominated producer of Carol and The Crying Game, among others, told The Hollywood Reporter on Sunday that almost 30 years ago, an unnamed young female executive who had worked at Miramax with Weinstein had found him naked in her bedroom one night. The exec was in a house rented by Miramax at the time to cut its overheads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liza Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;: A freelance script reader, she told the UK&amp;#39;s Sunday Times that Weinstein had summoned her to his hotel room in London before telling her to get in the bath with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Sivan&lt;/strong&gt;: The former Fox news host said that Weinstein trapped her in a closed restaurant and masturbated in front of her to completion in 2007.

Garai, best known for her role in &amp;quot;Atonement&amp;quot;, said she had already been hired for a part but was told to audition privately with the Hollywood mogul because &amp;#39;you had to be personally approved by him&amp;#39;. &amp;quot;Like every other woman in the industry, I&amp;#39;ve had an &amp;#39;audition&amp;#39; with Harvey Weinstein,&amp;quot; she told The Guardian. &amp;#39;So I had to go to his hotel room in the Savoy and he answered the door in his bathrobe.
