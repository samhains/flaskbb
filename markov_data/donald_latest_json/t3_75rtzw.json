translated by me:\n\n&gt;A Martin Luther of Islam? In the year of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's reformation, the Islamic scholar and religious educator Abdel-Hakim Ourghi, of Freiburg, has nailed 40 theses of Islamic reformation to the door of a mosque in Berlin. On Saturday morning, Ourghi stapled his theses of a humanistic, peaceable Islam onto the door of the Dar Assalam Mosque (\"Community Meeting Place of Neuk\u00f6lln [a suburb of Berlin]\"). The founder of the liberal Ibn Rushd Goethe Mosque, which is also located in Berlin, presented his book titled \"Reform of Islam. 40 Theses\" the day before.\n\nLater on in the article, the scholar states:\n\n&gt;In reality, the West should be our rulers [not the other way around]\n\n\nI would also like to highlight some of the theses that he wrote.\n\n&gt;#1. It is time for a European Islam\n&gt;#5. The heritage of Islam must be able to be researched freely\n&gt;#13. Islam is not a universal religion, as the Quran is a religious document addressed to the Arabs\n&gt;#17. To err is human; the Prophet himself had erred\n&gt;#32.

Unreformed Islam is *not* a religion of peace\n\nSome commentary on the theses:  thesis 17 strikes at the core of the current belief systems of Islam, which is that Mohammed could not err. As such, policy and social beliefs are informed by the notion that Mohammed could do no wrong, so anything that the prophet did, should be allowed. We see the conflict with the modern world that this belief has when considering Mohammed's child wife, Aisha; doing away with the simplistic notion that a human prophet cannot err would allow Islam to be united with the modern world.\n\nThesis 32 is very liberal, and typically a view adapted by atheists, agnostics, and followers of more modern religions. I do not believe that any feasible version of reformed Islam would carry this view.\n\nThesis 36 and 37 strike against the liberal narrative that Islamic extremism has nothing to do with mainstream Islamic beliefs, and the notion that Islam is a religion of peace. In order for Islam to be adapted to the modern world, its scholars must first openly admit and condemn the many passages that call for violence against nonbelievers and sinners alike.\n\nspez: formatting", "edited": 1507754547.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First paragraph translated by me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Martin Luther of Islam?
